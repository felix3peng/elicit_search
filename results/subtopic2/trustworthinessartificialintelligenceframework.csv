Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"A comprehensive trustworthy AI framework involves various aspects including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

This need is embodied in the development of recommendations and standards to obtain maximum benefits from the use of AI and minimize possible risks. The regulatory framework is being built on a human-centric basis. Accordingly, the developed standards should form the basis for further activities aimed at the use of AI and be applicable at all stages of creating practical solutions. Therefore, an important stage is the formalization of requirements, principles and provisions of legal and ethical norms in the form of practical template approaches for practical application. With this method, models and ontology of standardized concept of AI credibility are developed within the research. This made it possible to identify the main concepts that allow forming a position of trust, are a meaningful part of the concept of trustworthy AI, determine the need for its existence and pose a threat to it. On the basis of ontology of the domain area, models were developed and further decomposition of structural substantive concepts was carried out. In the future, the characteristics of the concept of trustworthiness formation are defined.",,
Trustworthiness in Industrial IoT Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence,The reliability of smart industrial systems can be assessed in real time using machine learning.,Search,2021,81,"Zhihan  Lv, Yang  Han, Amit Kumar Singh, Gunasekaran  Manogaran, Haibin  Lv",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79086f67c5d7413a05305478b1b38781588ed19d,,"The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources. In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.",,
Cultivating Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Digital Government,The current AI context challenges traditional government decision-making processes and threatens the democratic values within which they are framed.,Search,2020,5,"Teresa M.

These conditions argue for conservative approaches to AI that focus on cultivating and sustaining public trust. We use the extended Brunswik lens model as a framework to illustrate the distinctions between policy analysis and decision making as we have traditionally understood and practiced them and how they are evolving in the current AI context along with the challenges this poses for the use of trustworthy AI. We offer a set of recommendations for practices, processes, and governance structures in government to provide for trust in AI and suggest lines of research that support them.",,

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

Achieving Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence: Multi-Source Trust Transfer in Artificial In- telligence-capable Technology,A survey among 432 participants confirmed that users transfer their trust from known technologies and providers to AI-capable technologies and their providers.,Search,2021,,Maximilian  Renner,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d9e767f8c7395b275db8f4d02f053997233024b,,"Contemporary research focuses on examining trustworthy AI but neglects to consider trust transfer processes, proposing that users’ established trust in a familiar source (e.g., a technology or person) may transfer to a novel target. We argue that such trust transfer processes also occur in the case of novel AI-capable technologies, as they are the result of the convergence of AI with one or more base technologies. We develop a model with a focus on multi-source trust transfer while including the theoretical framework of trustduality (i.e., trust in providers and trust in technologies) to advance our understanding about trust transfer. A survey among 432 participants confirms that users transfer their trust from known technologies and providers (i.e., vehicle and AI technology) to AI-capable technologies and their providers. The study contributes by providing a novel theoretical perspective on establishing trustworthy AI by validating the importance of the duality of trust.",,

At the same time, there is also awareness of potential risks and harm that may be caused by unregulated developments of artificial intelligence. Guiding principles are being developed around the world to foster trustworthy development and application of artificial intelligence systems. These guidelines can support developers and governing authorities when making decisions about the use of artificial intelligence. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission launched the report Ethical guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence in2019. The report aims to contribute to reflections and the discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies also beyond the countries of the European Union (EU). In this paper, we use the global health sector as a case and argue that the EU’s guidance leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally. We point to the urgency of shared globalized efforts to safeguard against the potential harms of artificial intelligence technologies in health care.",,

Such data may support improving the quality of service, but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can benefit from these methods.",,
Trustworthiness Inference Framework in the Social Internet of Things: A Context-Aware Approach,A context-aware trustworthiness inference framework can calculate familiarity and similarity trust.,Search,2019,17,"Hui  Xia, Fu  Xiao, San-shun  Zhang, Chunqiang  Hu, Xiuzhen  Cheng",IEEE INFOCOM 2019 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737491,https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737491,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a693926341cc03c35d6b10d71a626401f67f543c,,"The concept of social networking is integrated into Internet of things (IoT) to socialize smart objects by mimicking human behaviors, leading to a new paradigm of Social Internet of Things (SIoT). A crucial problem that needs to be solved is how to establish reliable relationships autonomously among objects, i.e., building trust. This paper focuses on exploring an efficient context-aware trustworthiness inference framework to address this issue. Based on the sociological and psychological principles of trust generation between human beings, the proposed framework divides trust into two types: familiarity trust and similarity trust. The familiarity trust can be calculated by direct trust and recommendation trust, while the similarity trust can be calculated based on external similarity trust and internal similarity trust. We subsequently present concrete methods for the calculation of different trust elements. In particular, we design a kernel-based nonlinear multivariate grey prediction model to predict the direct trust of a specific object, which acts as the core module of the entire framework. Besides, considering the fuzziness and uncertainty in the concept of trust, we introduce the fuzzy logic method to synthesize these trust elements. The experimental results verify the validity of the core module and the resistance to attacks of this framework.",,

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,
