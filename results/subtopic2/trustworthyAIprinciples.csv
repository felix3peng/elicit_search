Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"AI practitioners need to develop AI systems that are robust, generalizable, explainable, transparent, reproducible, fair, private, and aligned with human values.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Trustworthy AI and Corporate Governance – The EU’s Ethics Guidelines For Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence from a Company Law Perspective,"The EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI will influence corporate governance, including company law rules.",Search,2020,5,"Eleanore  Hickman, Martin  Petrin",,,10.2139/ssrn.3607225,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3607225,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/72b39cf03173e4ced50e54873dac32258bbbfe16,,"AI will change many aspects of the world we live in, including the way corporations are governed. Many efficiencies and improvements are likely, but there are also potential dangers, including the threat of harmful impacts on third parties, discriminatory practices, data and privacy breaches, fraudulent practices and even ‘rogue AI’. To address these dangers, the EU published its 'Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI’. The Guidelines produce seven principles from its four foundational pillars of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness and explicability.

If implemented by business, the impact on corporate governance will be substantial. Fundamental questions at the intersection of ethics and law are considered but, because the Guidelines only address the former without much reference to the latter, their practical application is challenging for business. Further, while they promote many positive corporate governance principles, it is clear that the Guidelines' general nature leaves many questions and concerns unanswered.

In this paper we examine the potential significance and impact of the Guidelines on selected corporate law and governance issues. We conclude that more specificity is needed in relation to how the principles therein will harmonise with company law rules and governance practices. However, despite their imperfections, until harder legislative instruments emerge, the Guidelines provide a useful starting point for directing businesses towards establishing trustworthy AI.",,
An agile framework for trustworthy AI,The AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) ethics guidelines present a list of requirements that trustworthy AI systems should meet.,Search,2020,2,"Stefan  Leijnen, Huib  Aldewereld, Rudy van Belkom, Roland  Bijvank, Roelant  Ossewaarde",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880049a16c8fea47dcfe07450668f5507db5e96d,,"From the article: The ethics guidelines put forward by the AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) present a list of seven key requirements that Human-centered, trustworthy AI systems should meet. These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,

The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,Trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems.,Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,

Questioning the diversity of the Commssion’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, the dangers of ethics shopping are exposed as well as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights explored as already well established alternative reference framework for AI. Having exposed the need for effective red lines, not only the hidden social and ecological cost are assessed, but also the risk of “buying-out” research and other ethical issues neglected in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. Finally, three key weaknesses concerning the crucial translation of ethical principles into practice (enforcement) are highlighted.",,

Nine months later, its first deliverable was published, putting forward a comprehensive framework to achieve “Trustworthy AI” by offering ethical guidance to AI practitioners. This paper dives into the work carried out by the group, focusing in particular on its AI Ethics Guidelines. First, this paper clarifies the context that led to the creation of the AI HLEG and its mandate (I.). Subsequently, it elaborates on the Guidelines’ aim and purpose (II.), and analyses the Guidelines’ drafting process (III.). Particular focus is given to the questions surrounding the respective role played by ethics and law in the AI governance landscape (IV.), as well as some of the challenges that had to be overcome throughout the process (V.). Finally, this paper places the Guidelines in an international context, and sets out the next steps (VI.) ahead on the journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI (VII.).",,

The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

Such reports beg the question as to why such systems continue to be funded, developed and deployed despite the many published ethical AI principles. This paper focusses on the funding processes for AI research grants which we have identified as a gap in the current range of ethical AI solutions such as AI procurement guidelines, AI impact assessments and AI audit frameworks. We highlight the responsibilities of funding bodies to ensure investment is channelled towards trustworthy and safe AI systems and provides case studies as to how other ethical funding principles are managed. We offer a first sight of two proposals for funding bodies to consider regarding procedures they can employ. The first proposal is for the inclusion of a Trustworthy AI Statement’ section in the grant application form and offers an example of the associated guidance. The second proposal outlines the wider management requirements of a funding body for the ethical review and monitoring of funded projects to ensure adherence to the proposed ethical strategies in the applicants Trustworthy AI Statement. The anticipated outcome for such proposals being employed would be to create a ‘stop and think’ section during the project planning and application procedure requiring applicants to implement the methods for the ethically aligned design of AI. In essence it asks funders to send the message “if you want the money, then build trustworthy AI!”.",,Review
Trustworthy AI,"The six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems are bias and fairness, explainability, robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, improved privacy and security in model building, being decent, and model attribution.",Search,2021,,"Richa  Singh, Mayank  Vatsa, Nalini  Ratha",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f52a1c995d5b7ba2be6d419146dbf9ee6b0316c,,"Modern AI systems are reaping the advantage of novel learning methods. With their increasing usage, we are realizing the limitations and shortfalls of these systems. Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective.
