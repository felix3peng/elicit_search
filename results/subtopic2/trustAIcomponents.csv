Trust in Artificial Intelligence,"AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things.",Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,
Attachment and trust in artificial intelligence,People with high attachment security trust in AI more than people with low attachment security.,Search,2021,21,"Omri  Gillath, Ting  Ai, Michael  Branicky, Shawn  Keshmiri, Rob  Davison, Ryan  Spaulding",Comput.

Most research on trust in AI focuses on cognitive ways to boost trust. Here, instead, we focus on boosting trust in AI via affective means. Specifically, we tested and found associations between one's attachment style—an individual difference representing the way people feel, think, and behave in relationships—and trust in AI. In Study 1 we found that attachment anxiety predicted less trust. In Study 2, we found that enhancing attachment anxiety reduced trust, whereas enhancing attachment security increased trust in AI. In Study 3, we found that exposure to attachment security cues (but not positive affect cues) resulted in increased trust as compared with exposure to neutral cues. Overall, our findings demonstrate an association between attachment security and trust in AI, and support the ability to increase trust in AI via attachment security priming.",,
The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,Trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems.,Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,
Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be applied to the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations.

The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Australian Insights,Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the cornerstone technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and is enabling rapid innovation with many potential benefits for Australian society.,Search,2020,5,"Steve  Lockey, Nicole  Gillespie, Caitlin  Curtis",,,10.14264/b32f129,https://doi.org/10.14264/b32f129,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c2714f81bc323851052920d240bc21b98e2a9f8,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:b32f129/LockeyGillespieCurtis_Trust_In_AI.pdf,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the cornerstone technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and is enabling rapid innovation with many potential benefits for Australian society (e.g. enhanced healthcare diagnostics, transportation optimisation) and business (e.g. enhanced efficiency and competitiveness). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and investment in AI continues to grow exponentially.AI also poses considerable risks and challenges to society which raises concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO, Australia’s Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on “the essential foundation of trust”. Are we capable of extending our trust to AI? This national survey is the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and understanding community trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide important and timely research insights into the public’s trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems.Key findings include:              - Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by four key drivers;              - Australians have low trust in AI systems but generally ‘accept’ or ‘tolerate’ AI;              - Australians expect AI to be regulated and carefully managed;              - Australians expect organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI;              - Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work;              - Australians want to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses.We draw out the implications of the findings for government, business and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI highlighting three key actions:              - Live up to Australian’s expectations of trustworthy AI              - Strengthen the regulatory framework for governing AI              - Strengthen Australia’s AI literacy",,
Applied artificial intelligence and trust—The case of autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices,Firms must foster trust in applied AI in order to increase trust in the technology and the firm's communication about the technology.,Search,2016,271,"Monika  Hengstler, Ellen  Enkel, Selina  Duelli",,,10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/203b30269d27e158cd26bd1f47c3207f52e6aec8,,"Automation with inherent artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI.",,
Transparency and trust in artificial intelligence systems,Transparency can have a negative impact on trust in AI systems.,Search,2020,20,"Philipp  Schmidt, Felix  Bießmann, Timm  Teubner",J. Decis. Syst.,,10.1080/12460125.2020.1819094,https://doi.org/10.1080/12460125.2020.1819094,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a19f30e02c34c4eb7b197d3bcd4fbcb8a4e1602,,"ABSTRACT Assistive technology featuring artificial intelligence (AI) to support human decision-making has become ubiquitous. Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology.",,
Can we trust AI?

However, the diffusion of AI proceeds very slowly and falls behind, especially in comparison to other technologies. An important path leading to better adoption rates identified is trust-building. Particular requirements for trust and their relevance for AI adoption are currently insufficiently addressed.Design/methodology/approachTo close this gap, the authors follow a qualitative approach, drawing on the extended valence framework by assessing semi-structured interviews with experts from various companies.FindingsThe authors contribute to research by finding several subcategories for the three main trust dimensions ability, integrity and benevolence, thereby revealing fundamental differences for building trust in AI compared to more traditional technologies. In particular, the authors find access to knowledge, transparency, explainability, certification, as well as self-imposed standards and guidelines to be important factors that increase overall trust in AI.Originality/valueThe results show how the valence framework needs to be elaborated to become applicable to the AI context and provide further structural orientation to better understand AI adoption intentions. This may help decision-makers to identify further requirements or strategies to increase overall trust in their AI products, creating competitive and operational advantage.",,

The roles trust plays in various forms of interaction are considered, with the view that trust allows interactions between agents where there may have been no effective interaction possible before trust. Trust allows parties to acknowledge that, whilst there is a risk in relationships with potentially malevolent agents, some form of interaction may produce benefits, where no interaction at all may not. In addition, accepting the risk allows the trusting agent to prepare itself for possibly irresponsible or untrustworthy behaviour, thus minimizing the potential damage caused. A formalism is introduced to clarify these notions, and to permit computer simulations. An important contribution of this work is that the formalism is not allen-compassing: there are some notions of trust that are excluded. What it describes is a specific view of trust.",,
