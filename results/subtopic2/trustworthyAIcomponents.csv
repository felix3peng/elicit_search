Towards trustworthy AI: safe-visor architecture for uncertified controllers in stochastic cyber-physical systems,Safety and reliability of cyber-physical systems is currently very challenging.,Search,2021,,"Abolfazl  Lavaei, Bingzhuo  Zhong, Marco  Caccamo, Majid  Zamani",CAADCPS@CPSIoTWeek,,10.1145/3457335.3461705,https://doi.org/10.1145/3457335.3461705,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8d4b027951bd4bde6933e457bc89323cf8d9ea43,,"Artificial intelligence-based (a.k.a. AI-based) controllers have received significant attentions in the past few years due to their broad applications in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to accomplish complex control missions. However, guaranteeing safety and reliability of CPSs equipped with this kind of (uncertified) controllers is currently very challenging, which is of vital importance in many real-life safety-critical applications. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a Safe-visor architecture for sandboxing AI-based controllers in stochastic CPSs. The proposed framework contains (i) a history-based supervisor which checks inputs from the AI-based controller and makes compromise between functionality and safety of the system, and (ii) a safety advisor that provides fallback when the AI-based controller endangers the safety of the system. By employing this architecture, we provide formal probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of those classes of safety specifications which can be represented by the accepting languages of deterministic finite automata (DFA), while AI-based controllers can still be employed in the control loop even though they are not reliable.",,
A formal approach for the specification and verification of trustworthy component-based systems,Software systems are increasingly becoming ubiquitous affecting the way we experience the world.,Search,2011,38,"Mubarak  Mohammad, Vangalur S.

Embedded software systems, especially those used in smart devices, have become an essential constituent of the technological infrastructure of modern societies. Such systems, in order to be trusted in society, must be proved to be trustworthy. Trustworthiness is a composite non-functional property that implies safety, timeliness, security, availability, and reliability. This paper presents a formal approach for the development of trustworthy component-based systems. The approach involves a formal component model for the specification of component's structure, functional, and non-functional (trustworthiness) properties, a model transformation technique for the automatic generation of component behavior using the specified structure and restricted by the specified properties, and a unified formal verification method for safety, security, reliability and availability properties using model checking.",,

In this paper, we propose a supplier's declaration of conformity (SDoC) for AI services to help increase trust in AI services. An SDoC is a transparent, standardized, but often not legally required, document used in many industries and sectors to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. We envision an SDoC for AI services to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed and voluntarily released by AI service providers for examination by consumers. Importantly, it conveys product-level rather than component-level functional testing. We suggest a set of declaration items tailored to AI and provide examples for two fictitious AI services.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"Current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be used for the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

Can AI-based Components be Part of Dependable Systems?,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques seem to be a solution for complex problems.,Search,2020,,"Torge  Hinrichs, Bettina  Buth",2020 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),,10.1109/IV47402.2020.9304740,https://doi.org/10.1109/IV47402.2020.9304740,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/44d98bf5026c4327615523def2c21e3f32b5bf87,,"Artificial Intelligence and especially Machine Learning have become main topics in the scientific community as well as in industry. These techniques seem to be a solution for complex problems and are suggested even for critical applications such as the medical diagnosis, predictive analytic in finance or autonomous driving. But will it be feasible to employ such techniques in critical systems in the avionics, train, or medical domain taking into account the current regulations in domain-specific standard relating to dependability? Validation, verification and certification in these domains strongly rely on explicit traceability and provability of functional and dependability requirements down to the code level. This seems to be impossible for components derived using e.g. learning approaches. Nonetheless, scientific community and industry do not want to lose the advantages related to AI-based techniques – new ways to ensure the required level of confidence just need to be found. This is a process that requires people with different professional background to work together – and it has started. This paper presents selected aspects relating to the current state of the art with regard to AI and dependable systems and describes ongoing activities and ideas for obstacle detection and routing for autonomous driving at HAW Hamburg.",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,

In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can benefit from these methods.",,

Based on my previous research outcome AI development companies are still in the beginning of this process or have not even started yet. How is it possible to decrease the entry level barrier to kickoff AI ethics implementation? I tackle this question by combining AI ethics research with previous research findings to create the Trustworthy AI Implementation (TAII) framework. A literature review was conducted and that specifies the research and implementation status for each process step. The aim is to kickoff AI ethics and to transfer research and abstract guidelines from academia to business. The TAII process generates a meta perspective on the systemic dependencies of ethics for the company ecosystem. It generates orienteering for the AI ethics kickoff without requiring a deep background in philosophy and considers perspectives of social impact outside the software and data engineering setting. Depending on the legal regulation or area of application, the TAII process can be adapted and used with different regulations and ethical principles.",,Review
The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,"Trustworthiness technologies can support the required qualities of fair, explainable, auditable, and safe machine learning.",Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,

Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review
