These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

Nine months later, its first deliverable was published, putting forward a comprehensive framework to achieve “Trustworthy AI” by offering ethical guidance to AI practitioners. This paper dives into the work carried out by the group, focusing in particular on its AI Ethics Guidelines. First, this paper clarifies the context that led to the creation of the AI HLEG and its mandate (I.). Subsequently, it elaborates on the Guidelines’ aim and purpose (II.), and analyses the Guidelines’ drafting process (III.). Particular focus is given to the questions surrounding the respective role played by ethics and law in the AI governance landscape (IV.), as well as some of the challenges that had to be overcome throughout the process (V.). Finally, this paper places the Guidelines in an international context, and sets out the next steps (VI.) ahead on the journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI (VII.).",,

Their use raises ethical, social and legal issues. Here we demonstrate how the guidelines for trustworthy AI, can assist to answer those ethical issues in the case of clinical trials (CT).

In 2018 the European Commission established the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). The group proposed Guidelines to promote Trustworthy AI, with three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle, as it should be lawful, ethical and robust.

Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for people and societies to develop, and use AI systems. We used a focus group methodology to explore how the guidelines for trustworthy AI can assist to answer the ethical issues that rise by the application of AI in CTs.

The discussion was directed to the seven requirements for trustworthy AI in CTs, by questions like:

Are they relevant in CTs as a whole? Would they be applicable to the use of IIT as AI in CTs? Are you currently applying part, or all, of the proposed list? In the future, would you attach some, or all, of the proposed list? Is the administrative burden of applying the requirements justified by the effect?

It was recommended that:

the guidelines are relevant in the conduct of the CT; planning and implementation of CTs using IIT, should take them into account; ethical aspects and challenges are of the utmost importance; the proposed list is a very comprehensive framework; particular attention should be paid where more vulnerable groups are affected; the administrative burden is acceptable, as the effect exceeds the resources invested.

IIT are becoming increasingly important in medicine, and requirements for trustworthy IIT, and AI are necessary. Appropriate instrument in the case of the CTs are the provided by AI HLEG guidelines.",,

Guiding principles are being developed around the world to foster trustworthy development and application of artificial intelligence systems. These guidelines can support developers and governing authorities when making decisions about the use of artificial intelligence. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission launched the report Ethical guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence in2019. The report aims to contribute to reflections and the discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies also beyond the countries of the European Union (EU). In this paper, we use the global health sector as a case and argue that the EU’s guidance leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally. We point to the urgency of shared globalized efforts to safeguard against the potential harms of artificial intelligence technologies in health care.",,

How is it possible to decrease the entry level barrier to kickoff AI ethics implementation? I tackle this question by combining AI ethics research with previous research findings to create the Trustworthy AI Implementation (TAII) framework. A literature review was conducted and that specifies the research and implementation status for each process step. The aim is to kickoff AI ethics and to transfer research and abstract guidelines from academia to business. The TAII process generates a meta perspective on the systemic dependencies of ethics for the company ecosystem. It generates orienteering for the AI ethics kickoff without requiring a deep background in philosophy and considers perspectives of social impact outside the software and data engineering setting. Depending on the legal regulation or area of application, the TAII process can be adapted and used with different regulations and ethical principles.",,Review
The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,"Trustworthiness technologies can support the required qualities of fair, explainable, auditable, and safe machine learning.",Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,

Trust in Artificial Intelligence,,Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,

We highlight the responsibilities of funding bodies to ensure investment is channelled towards trustworthy and safe AI systems and provides case studies as to how other ethical funding principles are managed. We offer a first sight of two proposals for funding bodies to consider regarding procedures they can employ. The first proposal is for the inclusion of a Trustworthy AI Statement’ section in the grant application form and offers an example of the associated guidance. The second proposal outlines the wider management requirements of a funding body for the ethical review and monitoring of funded projects to ensure adherence to the proposed ethical strategies in the applicants Trustworthy AI Statement. The anticipated outcome for such proposals being employed would be to create a ‘stop and think’ section during the project planning and application procedure requiring applicants to implement the methods for the ethically aligned design of AI.
