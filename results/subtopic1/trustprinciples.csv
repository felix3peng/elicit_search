In this sense, the TRUST Principles emerge as a set of guidelines that seek to guarantee the reliability of digital data repositories. This research aims to verify the applicability of TRUST Principles as an assessment tool for data repositories, based on the analysis of the “Covid-19 Data Sharing / BR” repository. For this, two instruments were used: first, a set of criteria was developed to assess the repository's adherence to each of the TRUST Principles; second, a scoring system capable of assessing the repository's adherence to each criterion, on a scale graded from one to five, was formulated, the average score obtained in each principle was named trustworthiness degree. The scoring system was modeled using a software developed in the PHP programming language. It was observed that the principle with the highest value in the repository was Responsibility, while a low adherence to the Technology principle was noted. The research found that the TRUST Principles can be used as a useful certification tool for data repositories, as they direct their focus to very specific aspects of the repositories.",,

Trust is a moral value that does not depend upon personal experience or on interacting with people in civic groups or informal socializing. Instead, we learn to trust from our parents, and trust is stable over long periods of time. Trust depends on an optimistic world view: the world is a good place and we can make it better. Trusting people are more likely to give through charity and volunteering. Trusting societies are more likely to redistribute resources from the rich to the poor. Trust has been in decline in the United States for over 30 years. The roots of this decline are traceable to declining optimism and increasing economic inequality, which Uslaner supports by aggregate time series in the United States and cross-sectional data across market economies.",,

This article reviews definitions from various approaches within organizational theory, examines the consistencies and differences, and proposes that trust is based upon an underlying assumption of an implicit moral duty. This moral duty—an anomaly in much of organizational theory—has made a precise definition problematic. Trust also is examined from philosophical ethics, and a synthesis of the organizational and philosophical definitions that emphasizes an explicit sense of moral duty and is based upon accepted ethical principles of analysis is proposed. This new definition has the potential to combine research from the two fields of study in important areas of inquiry.",,Review
Elements of trust: Risk and perspective-taking,The egocentric costs and benefits of the trustor and the probability of reciprocity of the trustee affect trust decisions.,Search,2011,86,"Anthony M.

In the experimental trust game, game-theoretic rationality prescribes that trust decisions should depend on the potential risk (egocentric costs and benefits) and the probability of reciprocity (derived from the trustee's temptation to defect). The current work tests the relative weights of these elements. Experiment 1 shows that trust increases when costs decrease and benefits increase. The latter finding is critical because increasing the trustor's benefit also means increasing the trustee's temptation to defect. Hence, this finding suggests that egocentrism prevails over perspective-taking. Experiment 2 shows that the trustee's temptation to defect (negatively) affects trust, but only when the trustor's cost and benefit are favorable. Results are interpreted as reflecting a boundedly rational decision process.",,

Trust has been considered a form of human capital, a public good. Few if any social scientists or political leaders complain about there being too much trust. Many contributors to this volume are concerned with trust as a good. Trust is important in the functioning of firms and institutions. One of the qualities of good academic departments, for example, is that people do their work for real, without pretending or excessive complaining. Trust is also important in relations between citizens and government. Giving power to the government requires believing, or acting as if one believed, that the government officials involved will use the power correctly. Ultimately, this involves trust in one’s fellow citizens. They must not only be trusted to do their jobs when they are government employees, but they must also be trusted to be recognize and correct future errors of policy. Without such trust, change becomes difficult. People are afraid to risk giving power to the government for fear of some error that will not be corrected, so they attached to the status-quo.

Theoretical considerations over trust: relevant aspects for organizational behaviour,The earlier work on trust has not been wasted because each definition provided new information.,Search,1999,9,Ana Cristina Costa,,,10.17575/RPSICOL.V13I1/2.561,https://doi.org/10.17575/RPSICOL.V13I1/2.561,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f441b2d3ac5718e3638464af7f3fefb9e61084b,https://revista.appsicologia.org/index.php/rpsicologia/article/download/561/307,"The concept of trust has been studied by a large number of scholars from various scientific backgrounds. Trust has showed to play a major role in social relations, organizations, political systems, economic transactions and even in human-computer interaction. Many scholars appear united with respect to the importance of trust as a “public good”, necessary for the success of many economic transactions. Lewis and Weigert (1985, p.968) suggest that “trust is indispensable in social relationships”. Zucker (1986, p.56) followed with the statement that trust is “vital for the maintenance of cooperation in society and necessary as grounds for even the most routine, everyday interaction.” Luhmann (1980, p.4) goes further by arguing that trust is necessary to reduce complexity in the social systems, “absence of trust would prevent him (individual) from getting up in the morning”. Although the importance of trust has been acknowledged, its study remains problematic for several reasons. Since trust is a basic factor for the understanding of human conduct, its study is not restricted to a particular level of analysis. In the literature we find trust related to individuals, interpersonal relations, organizational structures, economic transactions and societies as a whole. In these contexts, several definitions have been proposed causing considerable confusion among researchers. However the earlier work has not been wasted. Each definition proposed, even with the limitations of its own approach, provides new information, adds insight and understanding to the meaning of trust. The fact that trust can be studied at different levels (individuals, groups and societies) and in different contexts, points out the relevancy of a multilevel analysis as well a simultaneous consideration of the context, in order to develop a meaningful framework for the study of trust (Rousseau, Stikin, Burt and Carmer, 1998).

Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,
Trust: nature and dynamics,"Trust is a disposition towards another agent (natural, technical, or social) on which our ""welfare"", that is, the realization of some goal of us, depends.",Search,2011,6,Cristiano  Castelfranchi,CHItaly,,10.1145/2037296.2037302,https://doi.org/10.1145/2037296.2037302,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3145cddfb0aefed58c65e385a4cc12bb6a178e39,,"Trust is a complex notion -- with various components and dimensions-, and a multi-role relation: Trust (x y t G c); x trusts y as for action/task t useful for goal G, in context c.

It is an attitude, a disposition towards another agent (natural, technical, or social) on which our ""welfare"", that is, the realization of some goal of us, depends. This attitude makes us disposed to expose ourselves to failure or damage by relying on y for satisfying our goal.

This attitude towards y can be based just on feelings of safety and perceived benevolence, or on feelings due to the analogical evocation of previous or similar positive experiences; or it is more ""rational"", or better ""reason-based"", grounded on some specific beliefs, evaluations, and expectations about y, that justify our reliance. On the basis of this positive expectation and evaluation we decide to depend on y.

Thus, trust also is a decision and an act: the act of trusting y as for t, of exposing ourselves to dependence. And it also becomes a specific relation between x and y. Trust in y (on the basis of the strength of our beliefs or feelings) can be sufficient or insufficient for our decision to delegate; depending on the perceived risk and possible harm.

The evaluation of y, on which the expectation is based, has two basic components: (i) y's ""competence"", efficacy, expertise: ""Is y really able and in condition to perform the expected 'action' and produce the desired outcome?"" (ii) y's ""willingness"": ""Will y actually perform the needed action?"", ""Is y predictable, reliable?"", ""Is y really willing to do the expected action?"". Clearly these two kinds of evaluation are rather independent: y can be very well disposed but not really skilled; or y can be really able but not credible.

Moreover, trust as judgment implies the 'internal attribution' to y of skills, qualities, 'virtues'; but it also imply some evaluation about the 'external' favorable or adverse contextual conditions for y's action. This is why not necessarily y's failure entails a decreasing of y's trustworthiness; it might not be his fault, but just due to 'external' interferences.

Trust in not only 'social', addressed towards other persons; it can be also towards some process or mechanism (I can trust or not a given elevator), and technology: how much effective and good is it as for its service; how much reliable and predictable; how much accessible and friendly;...? The opposite (but complementary) side of trust is the perceived risk and the perceived unreliability or unmanageability of the technology.

Trust dynamics is a very important and complex issue, with many aspects.

On the one side, there is the problem of trust transitivity: if x trust y, and y trust z, will x trust z? Not automatically: it depends on the specific object of those trust relations. If x trust y ""as good evaluator of t performances"" and y trust z as for t, then x will trust z as for t.

On the other side, there is the general problem of trust transfer:

(a) If x trust y as for t, will x trust y also for another task t'? It depends: do the qualities, skills, needed for successfully performing t overlapping with the quality needed for t'? If ""Yes"", the trustworthiness of y as for t is a good predictor of y's trustworthiness also for t'.

(b) If x trusts y as for t, will x trust z for t? It depends on the similarity between y and z: does z have the same qualities of y necessary for t?

Another important dynamics is trust as self-fulfilling prophecy. Trust is an expectation, but this expectation can affect the expected outcome, both its probability and quality. In fact, on the one side x's positive evaluation of y can increase y's commitment, effort, self-esteem, etc. and influence the quality of y's performance. On the other side, the fact that x is or becomes dependent on y can increase y's 'benevolence' or responsibility towards x. In general, it is well known that trust can induce trust and reciprocation, while diffidence elicits diffidence.

Finally, those dynamics can be taken into account even in x's evaluation and decision to trust: perhaps x's trust in y would not be sufficient, but x predicts that his act of trusting y will increase y's reliability and performance, thus trust becomes enough and x decides to trust/rely on y.

Trust technology. Trust is a very dialectic and dynamic phenomenon, and it should acquire the same level of quality with technology. There are two different (but not independent) perspectives on that:

(i) A technology really able to support social trust relations and to create new trust dimensions among humans.

(ii) A trustworthy technology deserving and eliciting trust disposition, which is not at all just a matter of ""security"", like engineers currently believes.",,

Trust in inter-organizational relationships,Trust develops from the reputation and behavior of the trusted party.,Search,2008,16,Risto  Seppänen,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6fcde53a6fdda15b4e1fbf77958463cd5db3f04a,,"Risto Seppänen Trust in inter-organizational relationships Lappeenranta 2008 200 p.

Previous studies have concentrated on the benefits of trust to business outcomes and economic performance, as it is considered to be a source of competitive advantage. Despite this increased level of interest, there is no consensus, much less overall agreement, about how it should be conceptualized or about the number of dimensions it incorporates. On the inter-organizational level there is an obvious challenge in defining both the trusting party and the objects of trust. Thus, the notion of trust as an under-theorized and poorly understood phenomenon still holds. Hence, the motivation of this study was fuelled by the need to increase our knowledge and understanding of the role and nature of trust in inter-organizational collaborative relationships. It is posited that there is a call for more understanding about its antecedents and consequences, as well as about the very concept in inter-organizational collaborative relationships. The study is divided into two parts. The first part gives a general overview, and the second part comprises four research publications. Both qualitative and quantitative research methodology is utilized. A multi-method research design was used because it provides different levels of data and different perspectives on the phenomenon. The results of this study reveal that trust incorporates three dimensions on both the individual and the organizational level: capability, goodwill, and self-reference. Trust develops from the reputation and behavior of the trusted party. It appears from this study that trust is clearly directed towards both individual boundary spanners and the counterpart company itself – i.e. not only to one or the other. The trusting party, on the other hand, is always an individual, and not the organization per se. Trust increases collaboration benefits and lowers collaboration drawbacks, thus having a positive effect on relationship performance. The major contribution of this study lies in uncovering the critical points and drawbacks in prior research and thereby in responding to the highlighted challenges. The way in which these challenges were addressed offers contributions to three major issues in the emerging theory of trust in the inter-organizational context: firstly, this study clarifies the trustor-trustee discussion; secondly, it conceptualizes trust as existing on both individual and organizational levels; and thirdly, it provides more information about the antecedents of trust and the ways in which it affects relationship performance.",,Review

Trust in other people has fallen dramatically in the United States over the past four decades as Americans have become less engaged in their communities and as compromise in our political life has become more and more elusive. The waning of faith in our fellow citizens is thus cause for great concern. A less trusting society is a less civil society. Like chicken soup, trust appears to work somewhat mysteriously.

There is no agreed-upon standard definition of the concept of trust, but the key idea is that “trusting a person means believing that when offered the chance, he or she is not likely to behave in a way that is damaging to us” (Gambetta, 1988, p. 219). While beliefs need not necessarily be supported by reasons, people often do trust a trustee more in the face of information that allows predicting his or her behavior. This means that a core aspect of trust consists in social predictability.

How does trust work? In the following, we suggest that trust reflects the absence of aversive uncertainty, which in turn depends on the degree to which the representation of another person overlaps with a representation of oneself. Based on the theory of event coding (Hommel et al., 2001) we explain how people represent themselves and others, how representational overlap determines trust, how that is affected by the situational context and the trustor's current mindset, and what this implies for interventions to induce and increase interpersonal trust.",,

This model allows to distinguish between internal and external attributions (to the trustee) and for each of these kinds of attribution it allows to distinguish among several sub-components: competence, disposition, unharmfulness and so on.

The notion of trust against a Trusted Third Party expresses the customer's faith in specific operational, ethical and quality characteristics, while it also includes the acknowledgement of a minimum risk factor by the relying party. Trust has the properties of selectivity and transitivity and therefore it must be properly delimited and restricted. The trust relationships have to be effectively managed at the client side, where a trust database shall be maintained in three abstract levels, containing all the necessary information to enumerate, distinguish and evaluate the relationships with other entities. The major factors that affect trust are reflected in the requirements for quality of the services provided and in the terms and conditions of qualified policies.",,
Towards trust management standardization,Recent research in the field of security has evolved into trust issues.,Search,2004,14,Denis  Trcek,Comput. Stand.

A majority of current approaches proposes techniques that support users' trust processes, while a minority of them addresses the essence of trust. The latter approaches form the basis for the work presented in this paper. Outer manifestations of trust phenomenon are formalized in order to facilitate the development in this field. The main goal is to provide means for computable trust that can be used in a standardized way for contemporary internet-based applications, independently of its cognitive principles.",,
Designing trust into online experiences,The designer’s goal is to engage users in online systems and establish and preserve trust.,Search,2000,464,Ben  Shneiderman,CACM,,10.1145/355112.355124,https://doi.org/10.1145/355112.355124,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d75b20805b243a3f0082bde19e4d4d24744d105,,"A ncient social traditions were designed to elicit trust during uncertain encounters. Handshaking demonstrated the absence of weapons. Clinking of glasses evolved from pouring wine back and forth to prove it was not poisoned. Now, new social traditions are needed to enhance cooperative behaviors in electronic environments supporting e-commerce, e-services, and online communities. Since users of online systems can’t savor a cup of tea with an electronic rug merchant, designers must develop strategies for facilitating e-commerce and auctions. Since users can’t make eye contact and judge intonations with an online lawyer or physician, designers must create new social norms for professional services. Since users can’t stroll through online communities encountering neighbors with their children, designers must facilitate the trust that enables collective action. In parallel, consumer groups must be vigorous in monitoring and reporting deceptions and disreputable business practices. Political scientist Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland calls trust “the chicken soup of the social sciences. It brings us all sorts of good things—from a willingness to get involved in our communities to higher rates of economic growth ... to making daily life more pleasant. Yet, like chicken soup, it appears to work somewhat mysteriously” [5]. He tries to sort out the mystery by distinguishing between moral trust, or the durable optimistic view that strangers are well-intentioned, and strategic trust, or the willingness of two people to participate in a specific exchange (see Uslaner’s “Social Capital and the Net” in this section). Trust facilitates cooperative behavior. It is a complex term that has generated dozens of doctoral dissertations, not only in sociology and political science, but now in information systems research as well. There are enough dimensions to trust and its failures to keep scholars and philosophers busy for some time, but e-commerce, e-services, and online community designers need a guide to practical action [4]. The designer’s goal is to engage users quickly and establish and preserve strategic trust under challenging situations. But for many users, strategic trust is difficult to generate, shaken easily, and once shaken extremely difficult to rebuild. Strategic trust is fragile. The extensive literature on trust offers multiple perspectives. In his politically oriented book Trust, Francis Fukuyama, a former U.S. State Department analyst, claims: “Trust is the expectation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behavior, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of the members of that community” [2]. This compact definition embodies several key con-",,

Trust and Trustworthiness,Trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of relationships.,Search,2018,279,"Özalp  Özer, Yanchong  Zheng",The Handbook of Behavioral Operations,,10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f05c70163160b4ec3b1a8cfc2ff0e87e50b943c7,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/120755/1/SSRN-id3046303.pdf,"In this chapter, we discuss when, how, and why trust and trustworthiness arise to support cooperation within and across organizations. To do so, we first define trust and trustworthiness, discuss how they can be quantified and determine key components of trusting and trustworthy behavior. In addition, we identify building blocks of trust and trustworthiness and offer tangible insights about how to establish trusting and cooperative business/inter-organizational relationships, based on both academic research and case studies from across industries. We all know that trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of our relationships, business or otherwise. Our friends, foes, family, colleagues, sociologists, management scientists, and even economists recognize this fact (even though some may not acknowledge it). We innately believe being trustworthy is a virtue (or, at least, are taught to think so) and have learned whether and when to trust (to the best of our abilities). And when we trust, we put ourselves in a vulnerable situation (i.e., we take a risk) based upon the expectation that the person we trusted (trustee) behaves in a positive way that is rewarding to us (as trustors). So, we make a risky “investment” of some sort and face uncertainty in the outcome (and may even regret later) when we trust. We also perhaps adjust our trusting and trustworthy behavior depending on the target of our trust, given the relevant context. For example, we may trust our significant other that he or she will return the $250 (or the car) we lend him or her (perhaps with an implicit or explicit expectation of a positive return beyond the actual loan). We probably would not ask him or her to write a contract before lending our car. However, most of us would perhaps require a marriage certificate (a binding contract that can only be annulled after a legal hearing) accepting all requirements governing a marriage before we commit “to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part...” and ensure that we provide and receive the care and commitment in the presence of conflicting objectives that we will all face during our marriage. Similarly, most successful business and economic relationships are built upon a considerable degree of mutual trust and trustworthiness. As Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow wrote, “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust” (Arrow 1972). Trust has been the glue for most transactions within and across cultures as long as humans have socialized and transacted. Business owners and practitioners are not oblivious to this fact. They do not begin talking with a potential partner by first writing a complete set of contracts stipulating all 1 Note that you neither need a marriage certificate nor need to rely on trust if (the big if) your spouse’s and your objectives are and will be perfectly aligned with absolutely no uncertainty 100% of the time during the span of your life. Similarly, in such a case, there is no need for a preor post-nuptial agreement.",,
Trust and Social Objectives,"Trust should be proportioned to trustworthiness, with morally favorable trust implied.",Search,1961,14,H. J. N. Horsburgh,Ethics,,10.1086/291373,https://doi.org/10.1086/291373,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/09c6a3eb1e6d33b00505ed1bf84fd91113d777e9,,"OCIAL objectives clearly depend for their realization upon the existIL ence of a certain amount of mutual trust between individuals or groups of individuals. This suggests that trust is good. But few think that it is. More commonly it is held to be good only when it forms part of a larger whole which includes the trustworthiness of those in whom it is reposed. In the absence of such trustworthiness it simply enables wrongdoers to increase the damage which they do to the community. Trust should therefore be proportioned to trustworthiness, people or groups of people being trusted more or less according to the degree of trustworthiness which they have attained. Although there is much good sense in these commonplace views they will not do as they stand. To begin with, ""trust"" is a slippery word in more ways than one. For example, it has two criteria, namely, confidence and reliance. Thus, A may be said to trust B to do x if B enjoys his confidence, that is, if A is sure that B has no defect of such a kind as to make it doubtful whether he will do x. A may also be said to trust B to do x if he is prepared to rely upon B's doing x, that is, if he is willing to run the risks of acting as if he felt certain that B will do x. Now, although a willingness to rely upon someone can be inferred from one's having confidence in him, an unwillingness to rely upon him cannot be inferred from one's not having confidence in him. It follows that these criteria are partially independent. Therefore, if one fails to distinguish them, and concentrates on reliance to the exclusion of confidence or upon confidence to the exclusion of reliance, one cannot do justice to the dilemmas of trust. Furthermore, trust sometimes implies, and at other times does not imply, a morally favorable, judgment on those persons or groups of persons in whom it is reposed. Thus, sometimes when I say ""I trust him,"" meaning that I have confidence in him, I am paying tribute to his good faith, whereas at other times when I say this it is his skill, sanity, intelligence, or competence that I have in mind, and a morally favorable view of him is not implied. In what follows I shall be mainly concerned with those varieties of trust which have moral overtones. ""Trustworthiness"" is also a slippery word. This can be seen from the fact that if it is interpreted in one way the common-sense position stated above becomes vacuous whereas interpreted in other ways it is not vacuous. Thus, if ""trustworthy"" is taken to mean the same as ""ought to be trusted"" it is analytic that one should only trust those who are trustworthy. On the other hand, if ""trustworthy"" is taken to mean ""incapable of double-dealing"" it is neither a necessary nor an obvious truth that one should only trust the trustworthy. I shall have something to say about the relations between trust and trustworthiness in Section IV. Finally, the simple view I am examining takes no account of a number of difficulties which should emerge in what fol-",,
