Importance of ‘Trust Factor’ in Corporate Branding,The ‘trust factor’ has garnered a lot of significance in business parlance.,Search,2012,3,"Subhodip  Roy, Lopamudra  Ghosh",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e1ab1751fb2bcc6ce71a0a28e5bd2a581e9c2bf0,,"With the growing consumer awareness and market competition, the ‘trust factor’ has garnered a lot of significance in business parlance. Trust is the belief that a consumer has in a purchase situation towards a company that it will deliver goods and services on a par with quality that the consumer expects. This belief is often accompanied by apprehensions about the company. Though trust could explain many marketing phenomena, it has been less researched. Thus the current study tries to analyze the attributes of trust towards a corporate brand, and builds a conceptual framework incorporating consumer trust in a corporate brand.",,
The Determinants of Trust,"A recent history of traumatic experiences, being economically unsuccessful, and living in a racially mixed community and/or in one with a high degree of income disparity reduce trust.",Search,2000,338,"Alberto F.  Alesina, Eliana  La Ferrara",,,10.3386/W7621,https://doi.org/10.3386/W7621,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d5b37e071b573cfb385de9f6e294f2aff0cf60ec,https://doi.org/10.3386/w7621,"Both individual experiences and community characteristics influence how much people trust each other. Using data drawn from US localities we find that the strongest factors that reduce trust are: i) a recent history of traumatic experiences, even though the passage of time reduces this effect fairly rapidly; ii) belonging to a group that historically felt discriminated against, such as minorities (black in particular) and, to a lesser extent, women; iii) being economically unsuccessful in terms of income and education; iv) living in a racially mixed community and/or in one with a high degree of income disparity. Religious beliefs and ethnic origins do not significantly affect trust. The latter result may be an indication that the American melting pot at least up to a point works, in terms of homogenizing attitudes of different cultures, even though racial cleavages leading to low trust are still quite high.",,
Factors Affecting Trust in Market Research Relationships,"Among interpersonal factors, perceived researcher integrity, willingness to reduce research uncertainty, confidentiality, expertise, tactfulness, sincerity, congeniality, and timeliness are most strongly associated with trust.",Search,1993,321,"Christine  Moorman, Rohit  Deshpandé, Gerald  Zaltman",,,10.1177/002224299305700106,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224299305700106,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5faa502d440c054f64512fda6b09111eaaffe628,https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~moorman/Publications/JM1993.pdf,"Building on previous work suggesting that trust is critical in facilitating exchange relationships, the authors describe a comprehensive theory of trust in market research relationships. This theory focuses on the factors that determine users’ trust in their researchers, including individual, interpersonal, organizational, interorganizational/interdepartmental, and project factors. The theory is tested in a sample of 779 users. Results indicate that the interpersonal factors are the most predictive of trust. Among these factors, perceived researcher integrity, willingness to reduce research uncertainty, confidentiality, expertise, tactfulness, sincerity, congeniality, and timeliness are most strongly associated with trust. Among the remaining factors, the formalization of the user's organization, the culture of the researcher's department or organization, the research organization's or department's power, and the extent to which the research is customized also affect trust. These findings generally do not change across different types of dyadic relationships.",,
Quantitative analysis of trust factors on social network using data mining approach,Data mining can infer quantitatively the relative importance of each trust factor with respective to the predicted class.,Search,2012,7,"Simon  Fong, Zhuang  Yan, Maya  Yu, Iris  Ma",The First International Conference on Future Generation Communication Technologies,,10.1109/FGCT.2012.6476587,https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCT.2012.6476587,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/159e280349622fc7427673f34adb9e93ffbf4bcd,,"Computing trust factors quantitatively is an important task in social network analysis, especially for online social networks where face-to-face interactions are spared. Trust factors can be used to infer degree of friendship as well as investigating what contribute to customer loyalty in e-commerce on online social networks. In the past, trust factors were either obtained via direct questioning during survey or qualitative estimation; questions to be asked are `how much do you trust something/somebody in multi-level Likert scale?' Respondents replied by indicating one of the following, for example: Very much, Much; Somewhat; Little; Never. The results are then counted usually by simple frequency distribution. In this paper, an alternative method by data mining is presented that infers quantitatively the relative importance of each trust factor with respective to the predicted class. This is done by Feature Selection algorithms prior to constructing a decision tree. The advantage of using data mining method over simple statistic is that each factor (or Relative Importance Factor) acts as a predictor variable that foretells how the likelihood of an expected occurrence. In other words, a-priori knowledge can be assumed in this case; the relative importance can be assumed known without the fact that actually occurred. Such relative importance measures would be useful for estimating the weights of variables that are used in some prediction formula. A case study of estimating trust and therefore inducing recommendation in Facebook is given.",,
Factors of trust that influence trust worthiness in peer-to-peer (P2P) based e-commerce,Trust between two interacting peers involved in an electronic transaction is one of the problems P2P systems suffer from.,Search,2004,7,"Farookh Khadeer Hussain, Elizabeth  Chang, Tharam S.

As a result, electronic commerce will be carried out over the peer-to-peer systems in the future rather than in a client-server environment. These Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems suffer from innumerable problems. Trust between two interacting peers involved in an electronic transaction is one of them. In this paper, we propose the factors that can influence the trustworthiness assigned to the trusted peer. Furthermore we catalogue these factors into three classes and discuss the relationship between these factors.",,
Who Will You Share a Ride With: Factors that Influence Trust of Potential Rideshare Partners,"Social proof, social approval, and self-disclosure are factors that influence trust forming.",Search,2017,4,"Yang  Zhou, Yan  Huang, Joseph  McGlynn, Alexander  Han",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/218731bd3ecec87719c4718f98b00a86ae3c6147,,"Ridesharing can save energy, reduce pollution, and alleviate congestion. Ridesharing systems allow peer-to-peer ride matching through mobile-phone applications. In many systems people have little information about the driver and co-riders. Trust heavily influences the usage of a ridesharing system, however, work in this area is limited. In this paper, we investigate the role of social media in shaping trust and delineate factors that influence the decisions of trust placed on a driver or co-rider. We design a ridesharing system where a rider can see the Instagram profile and 10 recent pictures of a co-rider and ask them to make judgments on six trust related questions. We discovered three important factors that shape trust forming: \textit{social proof}, \textit{social approval}, and \textit{self-disclosure}. These three factors account for 40\%, 33\%, and 13\% of the variance, and subsequent factors extracted accounted for substantially less variance. Using these three factors, we successfully build a trust prediction model with F-measure of 87.4\%, an improvement from 78.6\% on using all factors collected.",,
Trust Management: Literature Review,Trust has become popular in public debate and academic analysis.,Search,2011,59,Joanna  Paliszkiewicz,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7524e1e73c0a8f89bd153df36e0d35509255aa7f,,"The concept of trust has become popular in public debate and academic analysis. In high income countries this interest is associated with concern for the decline of trust in governments and professionals, and in developing countries has been prompted by debates around the motion of social capital. Trust has been identified as a major factor influencing such things as capital investment, relationship marketing, cross-cultural communication, learning and various types of cooperation. Trust management is becoming also very important inside the organization. The study will review empirical research on organizational trust. The purpose of the study will be also evaluation of the advancements and setbacks in current empirical research in terms of management organizational trust. This paper will analyze the theoretical approach, the conceptualization and the measurement issues covered in studies on management organizational trust. Although trust has emerged as an important factor in organizational relationships, there are still major conceptual and methodological challenges to be met when studying this complex concept.",,Review
Trust and its determinants,An increase in all significant determinants of trust in government by one standard deviation may be conducive to an increase in trust by 30 to 60%.,Search,2018,35,"Fabrice  Murtin, Lara  Fleischer, Vincent  Siegerink, Arnstein  Aassve, Yann  Algan, Romina  Boarini, Santiago  González, Zsuzsanna  Lonti, Gianluca  Grimalda, Rafael Hortala Vallve, Soonhee  Kim, David  Lee, Louis  Putterman, Conal  Smith",OECD Statistics Working Papers,,10.1787/869EF2EC-EN,https://doi.org/10.1787/869EF2EC-EN,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8395b1c63a1a51b5334b9947af8c7376f27da5b,https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/deliver/869ef2ec-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpaper%2F869ef2ec-en&mimeType=pdf,"This paper describes the results of an international initiative on trust (Trustlab) run in six OECD countries between November 2016 and November 2017 (France, Germany, Italy, Korea, Slovenia and the United States). Trustlab combines cutting-edge techniques drawn from behavioural science and experimental economics with an extensive survey on the policy and contextual determinants of trust in others and trust in institutions, administered to representative samples of participants. The main results are as follows: 1) Self-reported measures of trust in institutions are validated experimentally, 2) Self-reported measures of trust in others capture a belief about trustworthiness (as well as altruistic preferences), whereas experimental measures rather capture willingness to cooperate and one’s own trustworthiness. Therefore, both measures are loosely related, and should be considered complementary rather than substitutes; 3) Perceptions of institutional performance strongly correlate with both trust in government and trust in others; 4) Perceived government integrity is the strongest determinant of trust in government; 5) In addition to indicators associated with social capital, such as neighbourhood connectedness and attitudes towards immigration, perceived satisfaction with public services, social preferences and expectations matter for trust in others; 6) There is a large scope for policy action, as an increase in all significant determinants of trust in government by one standard deviation may be conducive to an increase in trust by 30 to 60%.",,
The Moral Foundations of Trust,Trusting societies are more likely to redistribute resources from the rich to the poor.,Search,2002,2215,Eric M. Uslaner,,,10.2139/ssrn.824504,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.824504,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8bd8a8a7d55ff05beb1ddc07e993a9e466ae90c0,,"The Moral Foundations of Trust seeks to explain why people place their faith in strangers, and why doing so matters. Trust is a moral value that does not depend upon personal experience or on interacting with people in civic groups or informal socializing. Instead, we learn to trust from our parents, and trust is stable over long periods of time. Trust depends on an optimistic world view: the world is a good place and we can make it better. Trusting people are more likely to give through charity and volunteering. Trusting societies are more likely to redistribute resources from the rich to the poor. Trust has been in decline in the United States for over 30 years. The roots of this decline are traceable to declining optimism and increasing economic inequality, which Uslaner supports by aggregate time series in the United States and cross-sectional data across market economies.",,
"Trusting and trustworthiness: What are they, how to measure them, and what affects them","The amount sent in the trust game is a good, albeit partial and overreaching, measure of one facet of trust.",Search,2010,224,"Avner  Ben-Ner, Freyr  Halldorsson",,,10.1016/J.JOEP.2009.10.001,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JOEP.2009.10.001,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3144ee4b3fabbd1ba58b4149bbc0201b7e99f892,,"The study examines trust by investigating potential determinants (factors determined at birth and childhood) and correlates (various views and attitudes) of trusting and trustworthiness. We examine behavioral and survey measures and conclude that the amount sent in the trust game is a good, albeit partial and overreaching, measure of one facet of trust. Common survey measures of trusting capture well other facets of trusting. The proportion sent back in the trust game represents well trustworthiness in the specific context in which it was developed, an investment situation, but falls short in capturing other facets of trustworthiness. The Machiavellian scale appears to be a weak measure of any facets of trustworthiness. Gender is the primary determinant of investment-related facet of trusting, and personality is a strong determinant of other facets. One personality trait - agreeableness - explains investment-related trustworthiness.",,
Elements of trust: Risk and perspective-taking,The potential risk and the probability of reciprocity affect game-theoretic rationality.,Search,2011,86,"Anthony M. Evans, Joachim I. Krueger",,,10.1016/J.JESP.2010.08.007,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JESP.2010.08.007,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7a71280a7b830ff977abc1021fdd57e36cdcd2c0,,"Trust is essential to personal well-being and economic success, but it cannot occur without accepting the possibility of betrayal. In the experimental trust game, game-theoretic rationality prescribes that trust decisions should depend on the potential risk (egocentric costs and benefits) and the probability of reciprocity (derived from the trustee's temptation to defect). The current work tests the relative weights of these elements. Experiment 1 shows that trust increases when costs decrease and benefits increase. The latter finding is critical because increasing the trustor's benefit also means increasing the trustee's temptation to defect. Hence, this finding suggests that egocentrism prevails over perspective-taking. Experiment 2 shows that the trustee's temptation to defect (negatively) affects trust, but only when the trustor's cost and benefit are favorable. Results are interpreted as reflecting a boundedly rational decision process.",,
Theoretical considerations over trust: relevant aspects for organizational behaviour,The earlier work on trust has not been wasted because each definition provided new information.,Search,1999,9,Ana Cristina Costa,,,10.17575/RPSICOL.V13I1/2.561,https://doi.org/10.17575/RPSICOL.V13I1/2.561,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f441b2d3ac5718e3638464af7f3fefb9e61084b,https://revista.appsicologia.org/index.php/rpsicologia/article/download/561/307,"The concept of trust has been studied by a large number of scholars from various scientific backgrounds. Trust has showed to play a major role in social relations, organizations, political systems, economic transactions and even in human-computer interaction. Many scholars appear united with respect to the importance of trust as a “public good”, necessary for the success of many economic transactions. Lewis and Weigert (1985, p.968) suggest that “trust is indispensable in social relationships”. Zucker (1986, p.56) followed with the statement that trust is “vital for the maintenance of cooperation in society and necessary as grounds for even the most routine, everyday interaction.” Luhmann (1980, p.4) goes further by arguing that trust is necessary to reduce complexity in the social systems, “absence of trust would prevent him (individual) from getting up in the morning”. Although the importance of trust has been acknowledged, its study remains problematic for several reasons. Since trust is a basic factor for the understanding of human conduct, its study is not restricted to a particular level of analysis. In the literature we find trust related to individuals, interpersonal relations, organizational structures, economic transactions and societies as a whole. In these contexts, several definitions have been proposed causing considerable confusion among researchers. However the earlier work has not been wasted. Each definition proposed, even with the limitations of its own approach, provides new information, adds insight and understanding to the meaning of trust. The fact that trust can be studied at different levels (individuals, groups and societies) and in different contexts, points out the relevancy of a multilevel analysis as well a simultaneous consideration of the context, in order to develop a meaningful framework for the study of trust (Rousseau, Stikin, Burt and Carmer, 1998).

Risk as a Determinant of Trust,The degree of trust an individual forms toward an interaction partner is a function of the degree of risk that is involved in the situation.,Search,1988,175,Michael  Koller,,,10.1207/S15324834BASP0904_2,https://doi.org/10.1207/S15324834BASP0904_2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/900439812f3026ef1cbb486267fe65fcf761561a,,"I propose that the degree of trust an individual forms toward an interaction partner is a function of the degree of risk that is involved in the situation. Two experiments were conducted in order to test this hypothesis. Subjects had to decide whether they would lend either an inexpensive scientific book (low-risk condition) or an expensive scientific book (high-risk condition) to a fictitious male fellow student. After subjects had made their decision, they had to indicate the degree of trust they had formed toward the interaction partner by means of a scale that referred to similar trust-related interactions. The hypothesis was clearly confirmed: The degree of trust was higher in the high-risk condition than in the low-risk condition. Results are explained in terms of self-perception theory. Implications are discussed.",,

In this study trust was defined as an expectancy held by an individual that the behavior of another person or a group would be altruistic and personally beneficial. An attempt was made, using this conceptual definition, to identify some personality and behavioral correlates of trust. Seven interpersonal relations groups with approximately 10 male and female undergraduates per group were studied with use of the Janis and Field self-esteem inventory, Schutz's FIRO-B scale, and the Rotter internal-external scale. It was discovered that a trusted person is one who is highly influential, has an internal locus of control, a low need to control others, high self-esteem, and is open to being influenced by others.",,

Several models for trust have been proposed in the literature but few explicitly take risk into account. This paper analyses the relationship between the two concepts by first looking at how a decision is made to enter into a transaction based on the risk information. We then draw a model of the invested fraction of the capital function of a decision surface. We finally define a model of trust composed of a reliability trust as the probability of transaction success and a decision trust derived from the decision surface.",,

Moreover, trust is lower in countries with dominant hierarchical religions, which may have deterred networks of cooperation trust hold up remarkably well on a cross-section of countries.",,
