A Trustworthiness Evaluation Framework in Cloud Computing for Service Selection,A trustworthiness evaluation framework for cloud computing can accurately and flexibly measure existing trust records.,Search,2014,9,"Lifeng  Wang, Zhengping  Wu",2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,,10.1109/CloudCom.2014.107,https://doi.org/10.1109/CloudCom.2014.107,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9cc6e96a2e5bd78ff9a4ecc007b3d6353ca50dc0,,"Cloud computing provides many benefits for individuals and enterprises by offering a range of computing services. The service dynamism, elasticity, economy and choices are too attractive to ignore. At the meantime, cloud computing has opened up a new frontier of challenges by introducing trust scenario. The Trustworthiness Evaluation of cloud Services is a paramount concern. In this paper, we present a framework to quantitatively measure and rank the trustworthiness of cloud services. In particular, we address the fundamental understanding of trustworthiness, quantitative trustworthiness metrics, unified scale of trust factors, trust factors categorization, trust coordinate and multi-criteria analysis for trustworthiness decision making. Our comprehensive framework of trustworthiness evaluation contains five basic building blocks. The preprocessing block query and calculate the existent trustworthiness record. Then the trust factors are collected, if there was no match record found. The trust factor management block categorize the trust factors and convert them by using unified scale. The trust factor processing block is for weighting and positioning of trust factors. The trustworthiness decision making block provide calculation of cloud service trustworthiness, and the results are recorded in our trustworthiness record block. The proposed trustworthiness measurement framework is employed in several experiments by using existing trust dataset. The analysis based on the experiment result indicates our trustworthiness evaluation is accurate and flexible.",,

Trustworthiness Inference Framework in the Social Internet of Things: A Context-Aware Approach,A context-aware trustworthiness inference framework can establish reliable relationships among smart objects autonomously.,Search,2019,17,"Hui  Xia, Fu  Xiao, San-shun  Zhang, Chunqiang  Hu, Xiuzhen  Cheng",IEEE INFOCOM 2019 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,,10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737491,https://doi.org/10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737491,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a693926341cc03c35d6b10d71a626401f67f543c,,"The concept of social networking is integrated into Internet of things (IoT) to socialize smart objects by mimicking human behaviors, leading to a new paradigm of Social Internet of Things (SIoT). A crucial problem that needs to be solved is how to establish reliable relationships autonomously among objects, i.e., building trust. This paper focuses on exploring an efficient context-aware trustworthiness inference framework to address this issue. Based on the sociological and psychological principles of trust generation between human beings, the proposed framework divides trust into two types: familiarity trust and similarity trust. The familiarity trust can be calculated by direct trust and recommendation trust, while the similarity trust can be calculated based on external similarity trust and internal similarity trust. We subsequently present concrete methods for the calculation of different trust elements. In particular, we design a kernel-based nonlinear multivariate grey prediction model to predict the direct trust of a specific object, which acts as the core module of the entire framework. Besides, considering the fuzziness and uncertainty in the concept of trust, we introduce the fuzzy logic method to synthesize these trust elements. The experimental results verify the validity of the core module and the resistance to attacks of this framework.",,

In order to address users’ trust concerns, trustworthiness requirements of software systems must be elicited and satisfied. The aim of this paper is to address the gap that exists between end-users’ trust concerns and the lack of implementation of proper trustworthiness requirements. New technologies like cloud computing bring new capabilities for hosting and offering complex collaborative business operations. However, these advances might bring undesirable side effects, e.g., introducing new vulnerabilities and threats caused by collaboration and data exchange over the Internet. Hence, users become more concerned about trust. Trust is subjective; trustworthiness requirements for addressing trust concerns are difficult to elicit, especially if there are different parties involved in the business process. We propose a user-centered trustworthiness requirement analysis and modeling framework. We integrate the subjective trust concerns into goal models and embed them into business process models as objective trustworthiness requirements.

At the same time, the risks to which these systems expose the organizations and end users are growing dramatically. Trustworthiness of software applications is becoming a paramount necessity. Trust is to be regarded as a first-class citizen in the total product life cycle and should be addressed across all stages of software development. Trust can be looked at from two facets: one at an algorithmic level (e.g., bias-free, discrimination-aware, explainable and interpretable techniques) and the other at a process level by making development processes more transparent, auditable, and adhering to regulations and best practices. In this paper, we address the latter and propose a blockchain enabled governance framework for building trustworthy software. Our framework supports the recording, monitoring, and analysis of various activities throughout the application development life cycle thereby bringing in transparency and auditability. It facilitates the specification of regulations and best practices and verifies for its adherence raising alerts of non-compliance and prescribes remedial measures.",,

While much of this research focuses on increasing users' trust, we present a framework that shifts the perspective towards factors that support trustworthy behavior. In a second step, we analyze how the presence of these factors can be signalled. We argue that it is essential to take a systemic perspective for enabling well-placed trust and trustworthy behavior in the long term. For our analysis we draw on relevant research from sociology, economics, and psychology, as well as HCI. We identify contextual properties (motivation based on temporal, social, and institutional embeddedness) and the actor's intrinsic properties (ability, and motivation based on internalized norms and benevolence) that form the basis of trustworthy behavior. Our analysis provides a frame of reference for the design of studies on trust in technology-mediated interactions, as well as a guide for identifying trust requirements in design processes. We demonstrate the application of the framework in three scenarios: call centre interactions, B2C e-commerce, and voice-enabled on-line gaming.",,

Guba’s constructs, in particular, have won considerable favour and form the focus of this paper. Here researchers seek to satisfy four criteria. In addressing credibility, investigators attempt to demonstrate that a true picture of the phenomenon under scrutiny is being presented. To allow transferability, they provide sufficient detail of the context of the fieldwork for a reader to be able to decide whether the prevailing environment is similar to another situation with which he or she is familiar and whether the findings can justifiably be applied to the other setting. The meeting of the dependability criterion is difficult in qualitative work, although researchers should at least strive to enable a future investigator to repeat the study. Finally, to achieve confirmability, researchers must take steps to demonstrate that findings emerge from the data and not their own predispositions. The paper concludes by suggesting that it is the responsibility of research methods teachers to ensure that this or a comparable model for ensuring trustworthiness is followed by students undertaking a qualitative inquiry.",,

Our approach uses the data provenance as well as their values in computing trust scores, that is, quantitative measures of trustworthiness. To obtain trust scores, we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependency property: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that created and manipulated the data, and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed from their value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the principle that ""the more similar values for the same event, the higher the trust scores"". The provenance similarity is based on the principle that ""the more different data provenances with similar values, the higher the trust scores"". Experimental results show that our approach provides a practical solution for trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks.",,

The framework consists of two layers: the presentation layer and the logic layer. The presentation layer is composed of input and output modules, which are the modules that interface with the users. The logic layer consists of the trustworthiness criteria and metadata creation modules.

After assessing the reliability and validity of this factor structure, the study also compares the five alternative models of trustworthiness. Results indicated that the trustworthiness model with the six first-order factors has the best model fit. Higher order confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify three second-order trustworthiness factors, which are competency, openness, and benevolence. The various dimensions of trustworthiness are viewable as levers of improving a bank's trustworthiness in the minds of its current and potential customers.",,
Trustworthiness criteria for supporting users to assess the credibility of web information,"An expert panel validated the proposed criteria 'Authority', 'Currency', 'Accuracy', and 'Relevance' as helpful to assess the trustworthiness of Web information.",Search,2013,21,"Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai, Kieron  O'Hara, Wendy  Hall",WWW '13 Companion,,10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://doi.org/10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9adf6b120bcb40e317160baed50cbbdb791931af,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful. Moreover, we obtain weighting scores for criteria which can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of information and suggest a piece of information that is more likely to be trustworthy to Web users.",,Review
Trust and Stakeholder Theory: Trustworthiness in the Organisation–Stakeholder Relationship,Organizations with organizational trustworthiness will fairly treat stakeholders who lack power.,Search,2010,196,"Michelle  Greenwood, Harry J. Buren III",,,10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7efca319d03e872333b9a7d7e0c60c6527b02522,,"Trust is a fundamental aspect of the moral treatment of stakeholders within the organization–stakeholder relationship. Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,
Quality of Open Source Software: The QualiPSo Trustworthiness Model,The factors that influence the trustworthiness of software products are their objective characteristics and the user’s perception of those characteristics.,Search,2009,37,"Vieri Del Bianco, Luigi  Lavazza, Sandro  Morasca, Davide  Taibi",OSS,,10.1007/978-3-642-02032-2_18,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02032-2_18,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ed1ad0eeb84960dc2d74466b5fab6ccebe9520ad,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-642-02032-2_18.pdf,"Trustworthiness is one of the main issues upon which the decision whether to adopt an Open-Source Software (OSS) product is based. The work described here is part of an activity that has the goals of 1) defining an adequate notion of trustworthiness of software products and artifacts and 2) identifying a number of factors that influence it. Specifically, this paper reports about the identification of the “dimensions” of trustworthiness, i.e., of the high-level qualities that software products and artefacts have to posses in order to be considered trustworthy. These dimensions are described by means of a conceptual model of trustworthiness, which comprises the representation of the factors that affect the user’s perception of trustworthiness, as well as the objective characteristics of the products that contribute to “build” trustworthi-ness. The aforementioned model is equipped with a measurement plan that de-scribes, at the operational level, how to perform the evaluation of the trustwor-thiness of OSS products. The proposed model provides the basis to build quantitative models of the trustworthiness of OSS products and artifacts that are able to explain the relationships between the (objectively observable) characteristics of OSS products and the level of trustworthiness perceived by the users of such products.",,

Trustworthiness has beenidentified as a condition precedent to the development of trust.Building upon the established constructs of interpersonaltrustworthiness, we propose a related model containing the sevenconstructs of Competence, Legal Compliance, Responsibility to Inform,Quality Assurance, Procedural Fairness, Interactional Cour-tesy, andFinancial Balance. Citing evidence from trust-related literature, weidentify the utility of these seven constructs in encompassingorganizational trustworthiness as a subjectively perceived aspect oforganizational effectiveness.
