Assessing the Trustworthiness of Drivers,Evidence captured by cross-brand comparison can reveal if drivers are trustworthy.,Search,2012,3,"Shengzhi  Zhang, Peng  Liu",RAID,,10.1007/978-3-642-33338-5_3,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33338-5_3,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7f02b1e54db5827c762e50eaf546c8dbe77fabf5,https://s2.ist.psu.edu/paper/RAID12-shengzhi-final-version.pdf,"Drivers, especially third party drivers, could contain malicious code (e.g., logic bombs) or carefully designed-in vulnerabilities. Generally, it is extremely difficult for static analysis to identify these code and vulnerabilities. Without knowing the exact triggers that cause the execution/exploitation of these code/vulnerabilities, dynamic taint analysis cannot help either. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-brand comparison approach to assess the drivers in a honeypot or testing environment. Through hardware virtualization, we design and deploy diverse-drivers based replicas to compare the runtime behaviour of the drivers developed by different vendors. Whenever the malicious code is executed or vulnerability is exploited, our analysis can capture the evidence of malicious driver behaviour through comparison and difference telling. Evaluation shows that it can faithfully reveal various kernel integrity/confidentiality manipulation and resource starvation attacks launched by compromised drivers, thus to assess the trustworthiness of the evaluated drivers.",,
An investigation into sharing economy enabled ridesharing drivers' trust: A qualitative study,"The key factors influencing trust-in-passenger are driving expenses, social interactions, enjoyment, cancelling the order, paying on time, politeness, appearance, rating and online reviews.",Search,2020,16,"Xusen  Cheng, Linlin  Su, Bo  Yang",Electron.

There is a lack of drivers sharing cars due to a trust issue in ridesharing. In order to understand the drivers’ trust and sharing intention in ridesharing, this study used a qualitative research method regarding uncertainty reduction theory (URT) as the main theoretical framework. By conducting and analysing interviews with the ridesharing drivers in China, this paper demonstrates that the key factors influencing trust-in-passenger are driving expenses, social interactions, enjoyment, cancelling the order, paying on time, politeness, appearance, rating and online reviews. We have also proposed a trust traffic-light model (TLM) of ridesharing as well as a ridesharing drivers’ trust (RDT) onion model to understand the importance of each factor and to exhibit them all. Meanwhile, trust-in-passenger influences the drivers’ sharing intention. This paper contributes to the field of ridesharing and trust.",,Review

The human factor challenges of designing safe automated driving systems are critical as the first several generations of automated vehicles are expected to be semi-autonomous, requiring frequent transfers of control between the driver and vehicle. Conditional automation raises particular concerns about drivers being out of the loop. A driving simulator study was performed with 20 participants to study driving with conditional automation. We observed driver performance and measured comfort as an indicator of the development of trust in the system. One scenario used a more capable automation system that was able to respond to most events by slowing or changing lanes on its own. The other scenario used a less capable automation system that issued takeover requests for all events. Participants drove both scenarios in counterbalanced order and experienced the different capabilities as changes in reliability. The automation would behave one way in the first work zone and a different way in the second. We observed three types of comfort profiles over the course of the drives. Several behavioral measures, notably gaze, showed effects of reliability variations. Trust calibrated during the first-driven scenario was seen to affect behavior during the second one, and this effect was more pronounced in the older age group, and most pronounced for women in that group.",,RCT

The study was carried out using a mini driving simulator and a simulated ACC whose reference speed and time headway (THW) were preset to 130 km/h and 1.5 s, respectively. Questionnaires were used to analyse driver trust. Two kinds of drivers emerge from the analysis of driver behaviour during the cut-in situation: drivers who reclaimed control from the ACC before the device began to regulate the THW with regard to the truck, and drivers who braked after the device had begun its regulation. The latter demonstrated a higher level of trust in the ACC device itself while the former had a higher level of trust in the cooperation with the device. These findings are discussed in terms of over-reliance and well-calibrated trust.",,

Analysis of the majority of road accidents demonstrates that the weakest part of human-machine DARE system limiting its efficency and reliability is a human. To provide necessary reliability and safety the driver of any vehicle has to be cautious. It is maintained by the appropriate psychophysiological condition which is in turn affected by many factors.

Augmenting the Technology Acceptance Model with Trust: Commercial Drivers’ Attitudes towards Monitoring and Feedback,The results of the study demonstrated that perceived usefulness is the most important determinant of intention to use an on-board monitoring system.,Search,2012,69,"Mahtab  Ghazizadeh, Yiyun  Peng, John D.

Crashes that involve trucks incur a high cost to society and driver-related factors contribute to about one third of all large truck fatal crashes in the US. Therefore, safety initiatives that can increase drivers’ awareness of their risky behaviors are highly desirable. In-vehicle feedback systems are designed to serve this purpose; however, their benefits will not be realized unless their information can positively influence safe driving. Acceptance constructs for the proposed model were measured using a survey administered after the monitoring system was introduced to the drivers but before the system was actually installed in their trucks. In line with the TAM, the results demonstrated that perceived usefulness is the most important determinant of intention to use the OBMS. Trust was also a major determinant of intention to use, suggesting that the acceptance model can be usefully augmented by this construct.",,
Driver's Trust in Automted Driving when Passing Other Traffic Objects,The automated passing speed was considered an appropriate one if automated vehicles take the same or slightly slower speed compared to manual driving.,Search,2015,9,"Genya  Abe, Kenji  Sato, Makoto  Itoh","2015 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics",,10.1109/SMC.2015.165,https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2015.165,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/58cba0c9f98295f0e04e638fb610e36597f6712a,,"The aim of this study was to investigate perspectives for securing driver's trust in automated driving.

A driving simulator study was implemented to investigate effects of applying characteristics of manual driving for each driver into design on drivers' trust when passing the objects. The results showed that driver's trust was affected by driver subjective speed, lateral distance and steering timing for automated driving. A longer lateral distance and an earlier steering timing for automated driving compared to manual driving contributed to subjectively appropriate speed and steering timing. Moreover the automated passing speed was regarded as an appropriate one if automated vehicles take the same or slightly slower speed compared to manual driving.",,

This study characterized driver interactions with forward collision warning, adaptive cruise control, active lane keeping, side-view assist, and lane departure warning systems following real-world use. Methods: Fifty-four Insurance Institute for Highway Safety employees participated and drove a 2016 Toyota Prius, 2016 Honda Civic, 2017 Audi Q7, or 2016 Infiniti QX60 for up to several weeks. Participants reported mileage and warnings from the technologies in an online daily-use survey. Participants reported their level of agreement with five statements regarding trust in an online post-use survey. Responses were averaged to create a composite measure of trust ranging from −2 (strongly disagree) to +2 (strongly agree) for each technology. Mixed-effect regression models were constructed to compare trust among technologies and separately among the study vehicles. Participants' free-response answers about what they liked least about each system were coded and examined. Results: Participants reported driving 33,584 miles during 4 months of data collection. At least one forward collision warning was reported in 26% of the 354 daily reports. The proportion of daily reports indicating a forward collision warning was much larger for the Honda (70%) than for the Audi (18%), Infiniti (15%), and Toyota (10%). Trust was highest for side-view assist (0.98) and lowest for active lane keeping (0.20). Trust in side-view assist was significantly higher than trust in active lane keeping and lane departure warning (0.53). Trust in active lane keeping was significantly lower than trust in adaptive cruise control (0.67) and forward collision warning (0.71). Trust in adaptive cruise control was higher for the Audi (0.72) and Toyota (0.75) compared with the Honda (0.30), and significantly higher for the Infiniti (0.93). Trust in Infiniti's side-view assist (0.58) was significantly lower than trust in Audi (1.17) and Honda (1.23) systems. Coding of answers to free-response questions showed that more than 80% of complaints about Honda's adaptive cruise control were about the way it functioned and/or performed. Infiniti's side-view assist was the only one with complaints mentioning circumstances where it was used. Trust in forward collision warning, lane departure warning, and active lane keeping was not significantly different among vehicles. Conclusions: Driver trust varied among driver assistance technologies, and trust in adaptive cruise control and side-view assist differed among vehicles. Trust may affect real-world use of driver assistance technologies and limit the opportunity for the systems to provide their intended benefits.",,
Trust in Technology as a Safety Aspect in Highly Automated Driving,The willingness of drivers to risk even severe accidents increases with the number and age of pedestrians that would otherwise be sacrificed.,Search,2016,33,"Philipp  Wintersberger, Andreas  Riener",i-com,,10.1515/icom-2016-0034,https://doi.org/10.1515/icom-2016-0034,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/80a2e5d1b8479ee65db9a0a6a187237266876a10,,"Abstract Trust in technology is an important factor to be considered for safety-critical systems. Of particular interest today is the transport domain, as more and more complex information and assistance systems find their way into vehicles. Research in driving automation / automated driving systems is in the focus of many research institutes worldwide. On the operational side, active safety systems employed to save lives are frequently used by non-professional drivers that neither know system boundaries nor the underlying functional principle. This is a serious safety issue, as systems are activated under false circumstances and with wrong expectations. At least some of the recent incidents with advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) or automated driving systems (ADS; SAE J3016) could have been prevented with a full understanding of the driver about system functionality and limitations (instead of overreliance). Drivers have to be trained to accept and use these systems in a way, that subjective trust matches objective trustworthiness (cf. “appropriate trust”) to prevent disuse and / or misuse. In this article, we present an interaction model for trust calibration that issues personalized messages in real time. On the showcase of automated driving we report the results of two user studies related to trust in ADS and driving ethics. In the first experiment (N = 48), mental and emotional states of front-seat passengers were compared to get deeper insight into the dispositional trust of potential users of automated vehicles. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we found that subjects accept and trust ADSs almost similarly as male / female drivers. In another study (N = 40), moral decisions of drivers were investigated in a systematic way. Our results indicate that the willingness of drivers to risk even severe accidents increases with the number and age of pedestrians that would otherwise be sacrificed. Based on our initial findings, we further discuss related aspects of trust in driving automation. Effective shared vehicle control and expected advantages of fully / highly automated driving (SAE levels 3 or higher) can only be achieved when trust issues are demonstrated and resolved.",,

Results demonstrated inappropriate levels of self-reported trust in relation to the corresponding level of reliability. In addition the DCMs were consolidated over a short period of time, but they did not match that of designers' model of ACC, thus better design solutions may be warranted.",,

Without trustworthiness assessment, a vehicle may not be able to trust other vehicles and, therefore, simply drop the data shared from others to avoid potential driving dangers. This problem was traditionally approached by protecting data security; however, the study of the trustworthiness of data generators (vehicles) is unfortunately omitted. We envision the existences of a vehicular social network on road, wherein vehicles exchanging data between each other are considered socially connected. Leveraging the trust propagation and fusion within a vehicular social network, the trustworthiness of individual vehicles can be accurately assessed. We adopt the three-valued subjective logic model to study trust between vehicles, and propose a holistic solution to trust assessment in vehicular social networks. The proposed solution enables objective and subjective trust assessment of vehicles, in a distributed manner. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution offers a more accurate trust assessment and a quicker assessing time.",,

This letter proposes a framework for the management of drivers’ trust in AVs. The framework is based on the identification of trust miscalibrations (when drivers’ undertrust or overtrust the AV) and on the activation of different communication styles to encourage or warn the driver when deemed necessary. Our results show that the management framework is effective, increasing (decreasing) trust of undertrusting (overtrusting) drivers, and reducing the average trust miscalibration time periods by approximately 40%. The framework is applicable for the design of SAE Level 3 automated driving systems and has the potential to improve the performance and safety of driver–AV teams.",,

Using a driving simulator, we first investigated the peak driving speed, the peak lateral distance between the object and the test vehicle, and the first steering input timing of human drivers while overtaking or passing. Next, the obtained data were applied to the parameters to design an automated driving system. Finally, we investigated the effects of differences in system behavior on drivers’ trust by varying the system parameters. The results demonstrated that drivers’ trust varied according to these three parameters. Moreover, the analysis indicated that an automated driving system should maintain longer peak lateral distances and engage in steering manoeuvres earlier than human drivers would in order to maintain a subjectively appropriate lateral distance and steering manoeuvre start time, respectively. Furthermore, the peak driving speeds for overtaking or passing should be kept almost equal to the manual speeds of human drivers to maintain subjectively appropriate driving speeds.",,

The research presented in this paper shows clearly that such assumptions are wrong in general, based on a number of real-life experiments using a real car (equipped with necessary sensors) in real traffic conditions. The experiments show that the same driver performs his/hers maneuvers differently, even though they could have been assumed to be the same or at least very similar.

As each vehicle cannot be a source of all messages in VANET, most communications depend on the information received from other vehicles. To protect VANET from malicious action, each vehicle must be able to evaluate, decide and react locally on information received from other vehicles. Message verification is more challenging in VANETs since the security and privacy of the participating vehicles, in general, and of the drivers and passengers specifically is of major concern. Each vehicle needs to verify the accuracy of the message and needs to verify that the received message is from a legitimate vehicle. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to secure vehicular communication with the help of trust measured for the given period using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm secures VANETs against the untrustworthy drivers. The proposed algorithm is illustrated through numerical results obtained from simulations.",,

Our multi-faceted approach to trust modeling combines priority-based, role-based and experience-based trust, integrated with a majority consensus model influenced by time and location, for effective route planning. The proposed representation for the user model is outlined in detail (integrating ontological and propositional elements) and the algorithm for updating trust values is presented as well. This trust modeling framework is validated in detail through an extensive simulation testbed that models vehicle route planning. We are able to show decreased average path time for vehicles when all facets of our trust model are employed in unison. Included is an interesting confirmation of the value of distinguishing direct and indirect observations of users.",,
A Secure Trust Model Based on Fuzzy Logic in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks With Fog Computing,A secure trust model can deal with the uncertainties and risk taking from unreliable information in vehicular networks.,Search,2017,123,"Seyed Ahmad Soleymani, Abdul Hanan Abdullah, Mahdi  Zareei, Mohammad Hossein Anisi, Cesar  Vargas-Rosales, Muhammad  Khurram Khan, Shidrokh  Goudarzi",IEEE Access,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2733225,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2733225,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3f409429dbf19e3d7d52154783237b49e02cd4dd,http://repository.essex.ac.uk/22262/1/07995031.pdf,"In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), trust establishment among vehicles is important to secure integrity and reliability of applications. In general, trust and reliability help vehicles to collect correct and credible information from surrounding vehicles. On top of that, a secure trust model can deal with uncertainties and risk taking from unreliable information in vehicular environments. However, inaccurate, incomplete, and imprecise information collected by vehicles as well as movable/immovable obstacles have interrupting effects on VANET. In this paper, a fuzzy trust model based on experience and plausibility is proposed to secure the vehicular network. The proposed trust model executes a series of security checks to ensure the correctness of the information received from authorized vehicles. Moreover, fog nodes are adopted as a facility to evaluate the level of accuracy of event’s location. The analyses show that the proposed solution not only detects malicious attackers and faulty nodes, but also overcomes the uncertainty and imprecision of data in vehicular networks in both line of sight and non-line of sight environments.",,
A trustworthiness-based vehicular recruitment scheme for information collections in Distributed Networked Systems,A novel vehicular trust evaluation scheme analyzes and supervises the data collected by vehicular sensors with a trust and low-cost style.,Search,2021,32,"Ting  Li, Anfeng  Liu, Naixue  Xiong, Shaobo  Zhang, Tian  Wang",Inf. Sci.,,10.1016/j.ins.2020.07.052,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2020.07.052,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f4a91d5b016732b2d11e083d430cf373ffa80b6c,,"Abstract Because of high mobility, large number of vehicles are utilized to achieve timely and quality-based information in the smart Internet of Things, which has formulated into a dynamic Distributed Networked Systems (DNS). However, designing a vehicular recruitment scheme to enhance a security-based DNS is challenging since it is hard to judge trustworthiness values of vehicular sensors. Therefore, in this paper, a novel vehicular trust evaluation scheme is proposed to analyze and supervise the data collected by vehicular sensors with a trust and low-cost style. To obtain vehicular trusts, the proposed scheme that considers time factor and gap between sensed data and real data is designed to calculate trustworthiness of vehicles. Moreover, sensing data in the vehicle sparse regions has more contributions because of its rareness. Thus, to inspire vehicles to sense data in the vehicle sparse regions, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is designed to pay rewards for the vehicular sensors. Finally, with real vehicular GPS datasets, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can improve accuracy rate of data sensing by 37.72% and can improve data quality by 76.95%. By incentive pricing method, coverage ratio of data sensing is improved by 13.1%. In general, performances of the proposed scheme can be improved by 19. 39% to 22.32% approximately. Future works focus on improving information security by advanced machine learning methods in the dynamic DNS.",,
"Balanced Trustworthiness, Safety, and Privacy in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications",Vehicular ad hoc networks must be trustworthy in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency.,Search,2010,206,"Qianhong  Wu, Josep  Domingo-Ferrer, Úrsula  González-Nicolás",IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,,10.1109/TVT.2009.2034669,https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2034669,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0942e19418f9fe38b54cac6ca63ab731a4e5ab2f,,"Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are being designed to improve traffic safety and efficiency. To meet this goal, the messages disseminated in VANETs must be trustworthy. We propose a privacy-preserving system that guarantees message trustworthiness in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Vehicle privacy is provided as long as a vehicle does not attempt to endorse the same message more than once. In spite of a message having been validly endorsed, if it is later found to be false, the system offers the possibility of a posteriori tracing the message generator and its endorsers. Our proposal demonstrates a number of distinctive features. The system is equipped with both a priori and a posteriori countermeasures. The threshold used for a priori endorsement can adaptively change according to the message urgency and traffic context, rather than being preset in the system design stage as in existing schemes. The verification of authenticated V2V messages is accelerated by batch message-processing techniques. Simulation results illustrate that the system maintains its performance under various traffic conditions.",,
