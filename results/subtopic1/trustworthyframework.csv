However, the problem of building a trustworthy cloud infrastructure to support TTS has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we aim to coordinate trust and security, and propose a trust-based cloud security framework, called trustworthy computing framework (TwCF), for TTS. In this framework, the application-aware policy is adopted to suit the users' security contents. A trust management framework is designed to manage trust, security and policies, and fulfil the trust negotiation and decision-making in TTS. The platform security mechanisms concerning the key elements in cloud security are designed to assure the deployment of security policies. In this paper, the key elements and emerging research issues in TwCF are identified and a case study of establishing a TTS in platform as a service (PaaS) is presented.",,
A security characterisation framework for trustworthy component based software systems,Characterising the security properties of software components is essential to developing trustworthy compositional contracts.,Search,2003,49,"Khaled M.

This enables software components as well as composers to ""test"" possible matches and mismatches between the security properties of the candidate components and the security requirements of the enclosing applications systems.",,
A Trust-Aware Framework for Evaluating Security Controls of Service Providers in Cloud Marketplaces,A trust-aware security evaluation framework could be useful for determining trustworthy cloud providers.,Search,2013,40,"Sheikh Mahbub Habib, Vijay  Varadharajan, Max  Mühlhäuser","2013 12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications",,10.1109/TrustCom.2013.58,https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom.2013.58,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a888b1d9cc3729450771683afd26ba0091019f42,,"Trustworthy selection of cloud services has become a significant issue in emerging cloud marketplaces. As a consequence, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has formulated a self-assessment framework for cloud providers to publish their cloud platform's security controls and capabilities. This framework enables consumers to select a cloud service based on the capabilities and controls published by the providers. However, a fundamental question that arises is, how can consumers trust that the security controls are satisfied as claimed by the providers and are compliant with consumers' requirements. This paper proposes a trust-aware framework to verify and evaluate these security controls considering consumers' requirements. First, we model the security controls in the form of trust properties. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of these properties based on their semantics and identify the authorities who can validate the properties. The taxonomy of these properties is the basis of trust formalisation in our proposed framework. The framework rests on the notion of hybrid trust that combines hard and soft trust mechanisms for verifying the trust properties. Furthermore, a decision model is proposed as an integral part of the framework in order to empower consumers to determine trustworthiness of cloud providers. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed trust-aware security evaluation framework could be potentially useful in practice for consumers to determine trustworthy cloud providers in a competitive marketplace.",,

At the same time, the risks to which these systems expose the organizations and end users are growing dramatically. Trustworthiness of software applications is becoming a paramount necessity. Trust is to be regarded as a first-class citizen in the total product life cycle and should be addressed across all stages of software development. Trust can be looked at from two facets: one at an algorithmic level (e.g., bias-free, discrimination-aware, explainable and interpretable techniques) and the other at a process level by making development processes more transparent, auditable, and adhering to regulations and best practices. In this paper, we address the latter and propose a blockchain enabled governance framework for building trustworthy software. Our framework supports the recording, monitoring, and analysis of various activities throughout the application development life cycle thereby bringing in transparency and auditability. It facilitates the specification of regulations and best practices and verifies for its adherence raising alerts of non-compliance and prescribes remedial measures.",,

This necessitates incorporating security from the very design of software. Isolation of software functionality into different modes and switching between them based on risk assessment, while maintaining a fail-safe mode ensuring device's essential functionality is a compelling design. Formal modeling is an essential ingredient for verification of such a design. Hence, in this paper, we formally model a trustworthy multi-modal framework for life-critical systems security and in turn safety. We formalize a multiple mode based software design approach of operation with a fail-safe mode that maintains critical functionality. We ensure trustworthyness by formalizing a composite risk model incorporated into the design for run-time risk assessment and management.",,

In this paper, we introduce a novel trust model that is based on security coverage through standards and certifications. To address these issues, author has kept a twofold aim for this paper: firstly logged all the factors that are considered imperative for IAAS security and verify how provider is assuring security related to these factors. Second is to present a “trust framework” that will calculate trustworthiness of cloud provider on the basis of security coverage of above-mentioned factors through standards and certification attained by cloud provider. The proposed solution can calculate two types of trust factors: overall trust factor (OTF) and service-specific trust factor (SSTF).

Trustworthiness of Web information evaluation framework,"The supportive information provided, based on and provided by the Trustworthiness of Web Information Evaluation (TWINE) application framework can help users to adequately evaluate the trustworthiness of Web information.",Search,2014,2,Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b29b4966596ccaeab5d6013efdb97fba4b60711,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. Firstly, there is little control over publishing quality. Secondly, when assessing the trustworthiness of Web pages, users tend to base their judgements upon subjective criteria such as the visual presentation of the website, rather than rigorous criteria such as the author's qualifications or the source's review process. As a result, Web users tend to make incorrect assessments of the trustworthiness of the Web information they are consuming. Also, they are uncertain of their ability to make a decision whether to trust information they are not familiar with. This research addresses this problem by collecting and presenting metadata based on useful practice trustworthiness criteria, in order to support the users' evaluation process for assessing the trustworthiness of Web information during their information seeking processes. In this thesis, we propose the Trustworthiness of Web Information Evaluation (TWINE) application framework, and present a prototype tool that employs this framework for a case study of academic publications. The framework gathers and provides useful information that can support users' judgments of the trustworthiness of Web information. The framework consists of two layers: the presentation layer and the logic layer. The presentation layer is composed of input and output modules, which are the modules that interface with the users. The logic layer consists of the trustworthiness criteria and metadata creation modules. The trustworthiness criteria module is composed of four basic criteria, namely: authority, accuracy, recency and relevance. Each criterion consists of the items, called indicators, in order to indicate the trustworthiness of Web information based on their criteria. The metadata creation module gathers and integrates metadata based on the proposed criteria that will then be used in the output module in order to generate the supportive information for users. The framework was evaluated based on the tool, using an empirical study. The study set a scenario that new postgraduate students search for publications to use in their report using the developed tool. The students were then asked to complete a questionnaire, which was then analysed using quantitative and qualitative methods. The results from the questionnaire show that the confidence level of users when evaluating the trustworthiness of Web information does increase if they obtain useful supportive information about that Web information.

This paper focuses on exploring an efficient context-aware trustworthiness inference framework to address this issue. Based on the sociological and psychological principles of trust generation between human beings, the proposed framework divides trust into two types: familiarity trust and similarity trust. The familiarity trust can be calculated by direct trust and recommendation trust, while the similarity trust can be calculated based on external similarity trust and internal similarity trust. We subsequently present concrete methods for the calculation of different trust elements. In particular, we design a kernel-based nonlinear multivariate grey prediction model to predict the direct trust of a specific object, which acts as the core module of the entire framework. Besides, considering the fuzziness and uncertainty in the concept of trust, we introduce the fuzzy logic method to synthesize these trust elements. The experimental results verify the validity of the core module and the resistance to attacks of this framework.",,

Secondly, a trustworthy Web service composition and optimization framework called TWSCO is proposed to guarantee the trust of composite service and efficiency of Web service composition process. The interface-matching problem among component services and user preference are considered in TWSCO, which firstly uses component services filter to remove untrusted component services. Secondly, the concrete services, based on interface similarity, are organized as clusters. Thirdly, a composite template among component services is formed at the cluster level to guarantee the trust and efficiency of composite service. finally, the best binding scheme is discovered by an optimization method based on user specific trust metrics.

However, with applications and services each employing their own DHTs that perform essentially the same tasks, an open infrastructure providing the core DHT functionalities for these applications and services would represent a cost-effective solution. In this paper we present a generic secure framework for deploying secure overlay-based applications/services. We combine DHTs and identity-based encryption (IBE) to develop a novel architecture that is scalable and robust against man-in-the-middle attacks. We also develop an innovative mechanism called ""Wheel of Trust"" that secures our framework against insider attacks. Based on the proposed architecture, we present some preliminary evaluation results from a prototype implementation.",,
Customizable framework for managing trusted components deployed on middleware,"The trust management is implemented as a kind of public service on a J2EE-compliant middleware platform, i.e., the PKUAS.",Search,2005,9,"Minghui  Zhou, Wenpin  Jiao, Hong  Mei",10th IEEE International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS'05),,10.1109/ICECCS.2005.31,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCS.2005.31,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f907962cc84656d89b600bb0ade74d033108f9fb,,"Due to the widespread trust threat under the open and dynamic Internet environment, the computer community has endeavored to engage in the studies of technologies for protecting and evaluating trustworthiness. This paper firstly defines trust from three aspects: trust relationship, trust property and trust entity, and build a uniform view for multiple trust properties. Secondly, according to abstract the common characteristics over varied trust properties, a model of trust management is elaborated, in which the trust entities, measurement model and trust policy are described. Thirdly, the trust management is implemented as a kind of public service on a J2EE-compliant middleware platform, i.e., the PKUAS.",,
Trustworthiness Assessment Framework for Net-Centric Systems,An ontology-based approach to provide systematic guidelines for net-centric system assessment is required to assess trustworthiness.,Search,2009,3,"Raymond A. Paul, Jing  Dong, I-Ling  Yen, Farokh B. Bastani",,,10.1007/978-0-387-87658-0_2,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-87658-0_2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/34c5710b7159345aa1023d446a1c5d5a0df5172b,,"Modern applications are becoming increasingly large-scale and network-centric, involving a variety of different types of system entities. Also, the assurance requirements for these systems are evolving due to the continuing emergence of new threats from new operational environments. To assure the trustworthiness of these systems to a sufficiently high degree of confidence is a challenging task. Most existing methods require different specialized assessment techniques for not only different types of system entities but also different trustworthiness aspects. Also, most existing techniques lack consideration of the overall system trustworthiness assessment from an integrated system perspective or fail to provide a holistic view. To address these problems, we develop an ontology-based approach to provide systematic guidelines for net-centric system assessment. The ontology-based approach captures evolving system trustworthiness aspects and effectively models their relationships and correlations. It can also organize system entities and associate appropriate assessment techniques for each class of system entities and their integrations.",,
Framework Proposal to Evaluate Trustworthiness in an Online Community,A software architecture extends current collaborative systems and the trust model uses information extracted from the artifacts generated by the online community.,Search,2009,4,"Adriana Maria C.

Both members’ interactions and the relevance of their contributions to the community are analyzed as trust evidences. To establish the relevance of a contribution, the community’s vocabulary is studied and its occurrence in each member's interaction is evaluated. We propose a framework that supports both the trust model and the creation of the community’s vocabulary. The software architecture extends current collaborative systems and the trust model uses information extracted from the artifacts generated by the online community. An experiment in the InVesalius community, available at Brazilian Public Software Portal, is presented.",,
