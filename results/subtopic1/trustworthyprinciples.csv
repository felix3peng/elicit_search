Furthermore, any set of principles is by itself clearly incomplete. However, considerable experience, understanding, and foresight are needed to use such principles productively. In this document, we itemize, review, and interpret various design and development principles that – if properly understood and applied – can advance predictable composability of components, total-system trustworthiness, high assurance, and other attributes of computer systems and networks. We consider the relative applicability of those principles, as well as some of the problems they may introduce. We also examine the pervasive way in which these design and development principles have inspired and motivated the prototype CHERI architecture.",,Review

The approach encompasses comprehensive sets of requirements, inherently sound architectures that can be predictably composed out of well-conceived subsystems, highly principled development techniques, good software engineering disciplines, sound operational practices, and judiciously applied assurance measures. Although such an approach is likely to seem completely old-hat to some researchers and totally impractical to commercial developers, the wisdom thus embodied is seldom used consistently (if at all) in practice; if it were used wisely, much of the untrustworthiness in today's systems would simply disappear. The paper briefly summarizes our approach and its potential benefits.",,
A component‐based development process for trustworthy systems,A component-based development process should preserve trustworthiness properties in every activity of every phase of system development.,Search,2012,4,"Mubarak  Mohammad, Vangalur S. Alagar",J. Softw. Evol. Process.,,10.1002/smr.472,https://doi.org/10.1002/smr.472,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/643105ed93a427632681c7e3d6999348c1c74c47,,"This paper introduces a new process for a rigorous component‐centered development of trustworthy systems. The rationale for our perspective of the process is two‐fold. The activities prescribed in a conventional software engineering development process are neither suitable nor sufficient for developing component‐based systems. Component‐based development methods that are currently practised do not support the explicit specification of trustworthiness properties, and are not based on rigorous principles. Hence they are not suitable for developing trustworthy systems. Trustworthiness is regarded as a composite nonfunctional property comprising the four attributes safety, security, availability, and reliability. They must be rigorously defined for components and systems composed from them. It is essential that the process enforces a direct evidence of trustworthiness in the systems that are developed following the process. Consequently, the development process, in addition to being reuse‐oriented, component‐oriented, and rigorous in all phases of the system lifecycle, should maintain the chain of evidence that the trustworthiness properties are preserved in every activity of every phase of system development. The proposed process includes several parallel interrelated tracks including component development, component assessment, component reuse, and component‐based system development and prescribes specific activities and tools for ensuring trustworthiness in all activities.

Trustworthiness in evaluation practice: an emphasis on the relational.,"The first consideration in designing and conducting rigorous evaluation inquiry, and in critiquing the results of any research, should be the study's trustworthiness.",Search,2007,29,"Sharon F Rallis, Gretchen B Rossman, Rebecca  Gajda",Evaluation and program planning,,10.1016/J.EVALPROGPLAN.2007.06.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.EVALPROGPLAN.2007.06.006,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b136f2d53707b1144c7e0ba63fdd6900d01d089,,"As canons for trustworthiness developed explicitly in the discourse of qualitative inquiry, the emphasis was on procedural matters rather than fundamentally relational ones. A nod was made to the relational in such strategies as ""member checks"" but the issues of how the evaluator actually relates to participants and to the larger communities of practice and discourse--matters subsumed under moral principles and ethical standards--were often marginalized. This chapter posits that the first consideration in designing and conducting rigorous evaluation inquiry, and in critiquing the results of any research, should be the study's trustworthiness. Judging a study's trustworthiness, however, should focus on much more than procedural matters; it should also rely on moral principles and ethical standards which specifically address how we relate to an evaluation's participants. Central to these considerations are cross-cultural sensibilities about the nuanced meanings associated with any principles and standards. The chapter provides a theoretical framework for this position and offers two illustrative examples in the form of dialogues.",,

The Significance of Group Trustworthiness We value trustworthiness where we find it, in friends, colleagues, and strangers. This is because it is easier to cooperate with trustworthy individuals than with untrustworthy ones, but also because trustworthiness is appreciated for its own sake. Conversely, we resent untrustworthiness when we encounter it, and try to minimise interaction with untrustworthy individuals. This preference for trustworthiness over untrustworthiness is not limited to our interactions with individuals. Who wouldn’t prefer to work for a trustworthy company, to be treated at a trustworthy hospital, and to vote for a trustworthy political party?",,

Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,

For this, two instruments were used: first, a set of criteria was developed to assess the repository's adherence to each of the TRUST Principles; second, a scoring system capable of assessing the repository's adherence to each criterion, on a scale graded from one to five, was formulated, the average score obtained in each principle was named trustworthiness degree. The scoring system was modeled using a software developed in the PHP programming language. It was observed that the principle with the highest value in the repository was Responsibility, while a low adherence to the Technology principle was noted.

Trust and Stakeholder Theory: Trustworthiness in the Organisation–Stakeholder Relationship,Organizations with organizational trustworthiness can fairly treat stakeholders who lack power.,Search,2010,196,"Michelle  Greenwood, Harry J.

Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,

Leaders who can admit mistakes, acknowledge weakness, applaud strength, and help each other, and who can promote those qualities in the workforce, will be capable of building trust. Mutual trust is important, and everyone has a lot at stake with trust issues because of the inherent risks. Those risks are about putting one's faith or a pending decision in the hands of someone in whom you have not yet developed confidence in, or in whom there are limits to that confidence.

How To Be Trustworthy,Trustworthiness involves avoiding unfulfilled commitments.,Search,2019,10,Katherine  Hawley,,,10.1093/oso/9780198843900.001.0001,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198843900.001.0001,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0d0797e85ccadaefb08ec61c97328ba2394069f7,,"The book articulates and defends a core notion of trustworthiness as avoiding unfulfilled commitments. This is motivated via accounts of both trust and distrust in terms of perceived commitment. Avoiding unfufilled commitments is crucial both to practical trustworthiness, and to trustworthiness in speech; on this picture, assertion involves promising to speak truthfully, and simultaneously either keeping that promise or breaking it. Both assertion and the incurring of practical commitments are governed by competence norms, as well as norms of sincerity. So what should we do if we want to be trustworthy? Two perspectives are important: we need to act in line with our existing commitments, but in addition we need to approach potential new commitments with care. We can become untrustworthy by taking on too many—or over-challenging—commitments, no matter how well-meaning we are. Considered narrowly, trustworthiness typically directs us away from new commitments, but this creates significant costs both for ourselves and for those around us. Moreover, we cannot always avoid new commitments, and encounter uncertainty about how we become committed. We face obstacles to being trustworthy, and trustworthiness can direct us to act in ways which are ungenerous, or otherwise unlikeable. Moreover, those of us who live in challenging personal circumstances, whether through material impoverishment, poor health, social exclusion, or power imbalances, face greater obstacles to being trustworthy. This is compounded by the fact that such circumstances—and their impact on the pursuit of trustworthiness—are not always visible to other people.",,

It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,

First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful.

Our lives increasingly depend on critical national infrastructures that depend in varying degrees on the dependable behavior of computer-communication resources, including the Internet and many of its attached computer systems. Unless certain information system resources are trustworthy, our critical systems are at serious risk from failures and subver-sions. Unfortunately, for many of the key application domains, the existing information infrastructures are lacking in trustworthiness. For example, power grids, air-traffic control, high-integrity electronic voting systems, the emerging DoD Global Information Grid, the national infra-structures, and many collaborative and competitive Internet-based applications all need systems that are more trustworthy than we have today. In this column, we have frequently considered risks associated with such systems and what is needed to make them more trustworthy. This month's column takes a higher-level and more intuitive view by considering analogies with our natural environ-ment—expectations for which are rather similar to expectations for trustworthy information systems. For example, pure air and uncontaminated water are vital, as are the social systems that ensure them. Although poorly chosen analogies can be misleading , the analogy with our natural environment seems quite apt. Each of the following bulleted items is applicable to both trustworthy information systems and natural environments. • Their critical importance is generally underappre-ciated until something goes fundamentally wrong—after which undoing the damage can be very difficult if not impossible. • Problems can result from natural circumstances, equipment failures, human errors, malicious activity , or a combination of these and other factors. • Dangerous contaminants may emerge and propagate, often unobserved. Some of these may remain unde-tected for relatively long periods of time, whereas others can have immediately obvious consequences. • Your well-being may be dramatically impeded, but there is not much you as an individual can do about aspects that are pervasive—perhaps international or even global in scope. • Detection, remediation, and prevention require cooperative social efforts, such as public health and sanitation efforts, as well as technological means. • Up-front preventive measures can result in significant savings and increases in human well-being, ameliorating major problems later on. • Once something has gone recognizably wrong, countermeasures are typically fruitless—too …",,

Trustworthiness*,We want those we can count on to identify themselves so that we can place our trust wisely.,Search,2012,39,Karen  Jones,Ethics,,10.1086/667838,https://doi.org/10.1086/667838,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6351a82a769a94b73cdf7e1d86bd37d84536943,,"I present and defend an account of three-place trustworthiness according to which B is trustworthy with respect to A in domain of interaction D, if and only if she is competent with respect to that domain, and she would take the fact that A is counting on her, were A to do so in this domain, to be a compelling reason for acting as counted on. This is not the whole story of trustworthiness, however, for we want those we can count on to identify themselves so that we can place our trust wisely.",,
Trustworthy by design,Organizations are increasingly reliant on mobile workers and the data they capture.,Search,2014,11,"Bran  Knowles, Mike  Harding, Lynne  Blair, Nigel  Davies, James  Hannon, Mark  Rouncefield, John  Walden",CSCW,,10.1145/2531602.2531699,https://doi.org/10.1145/2531602.2531699,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/01bf23ba31b8c0d5f03a3e415fe8b4e80db26cc0,,"Driven by changes in working practices and technology trends, organizations are increasingly reliant on mobile workers and the data they capture. However, while significant work has been carried out on increasing the usability of mobile devices and applications, little attention has been paid to the quality of data captured by mobile workers. If this data is inaccurate or untrustworthy, serious consequences can ensue. In this paper we study a system targeted at mobile workers in the highways sector that is deliberately designed to increase the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data collected. The resulting Inspections application has been very positively received by workers and we present lessons that we believe can be applied to other applications of this type.",,
