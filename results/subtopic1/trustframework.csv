Trust framework for social networks,A new trust framework for social networks can increase the trust view and reduce the errors in trust evaluation.,Search,2012,,Arjan  Durresi,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f13e823c8bf9e6eb1c13c27495d767a08b90258c,,"We are developing a trust framework for social networks. The framework includes new metrics for trust evaluation and its confidence. We consider trust assessments similar to physical measurements. Therefore, we apply measurement theory of errors in trust evaluation. We have tested our framework with real datasets from social networks. Our results confirm the validity of our approach. Furthermore, we show some great advantages of our framework, for example the trust view in an experiment was increased more than 2000 times. Our framework can be used to build security mechanisms for social networks, including filters against DDoS and untrusted information, detection of cliques of attackers and much more.",,
Trust management framework for social networks,"A new system of trust metrics, composed by impression and confidence, captures human trust level and its uncertainty.",Search,2012,25,"Ping  Zhang, Arjan  Durresi",2012 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),,10.1109/ICC.2012.6364031,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.2012.6364031,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/849d7b05678289ae1a54669e18935c6ec9a5e758,,"Inspired by the similarities between human trust and physical measurements, we propose a new system of trust metrics, composed by impression and confidence, which captures both human trust level and its uncertainty, while being intuitive and user friendly. Furthermore, based on measurement error propagation theory, we propose an evaluation framework to compute confidence according to impression transitivity and aggregation operations. Our framework can be used in all applications where human trust is involved, including various types of social networks. Experiments on a real social network validate our framework, as well as the enormous potential of our trust framework in various social network applications. For example, in an experiment on real data we increased 2250 times the “trust view,” while keeping the same level of confidence.",,
A trust management framework for service-oriented environments,A reputation management system can provide each entity in a system with the flexibility to apply different scoring functions over the same feedback data for customized trust evaluations.,Search,2009,122,"William  Conner, Arun  Iyengar, Thomas A.

We also propose a novel scheme to cache trust values based on recent client activity. To evaluate our approach, we implemented our trust management service and tested it on a realistic application scenario in both LAN and WAN distributed environments. Our results indicate that our trust management service can effectively support multiple scoring functions with low overhead and high availability.",,

Two challenges that are hampering the success of this technology are: security and trust. When security is assured, trust will forte and security lapse will definitely have a negative impact on trust. In this paper, we introduce a novel trust model that is based on security coverage through standards and certifications. To address these issues, author has kept a twofold aim for this paper: firstly logged all the factors that are considered imperative for IAAS security and verify how provider is assuring security related to these factors. Second is to present a “trust framework” that will calculate trustworthiness of cloud provider on the basis of security coverage of above-mentioned factors through standards and certification attained by cloud provider. The proposed solution can calculate two types of trust factors: overall trust factor (OTF) and service-specific trust factor (SSTF). This framework can assist cloud consumer in electing cloud provider for IAAS.",,

The mechanics of trust: A framework for research and design,A systemic perspective is essential for enabling well-placed trust and trustworthy behavior in technology-mediated interactions.,Search,2005,427,"Jens  Riegelsberger, M.

While much of this research focuses on increasing users' trust, we present a framework that shifts the perspective towards factors that support trustworthy behavior. In a second step, we analyze how the presence of these factors can be signalled. We argue that it is essential to take a systemic perspective for enabling well-placed trust and trustworthy behavior in the long term. For our analysis we draw on relevant research from sociology, economics, and psychology, as well as HCI. We identify contextual properties (motivation based on temporal, social, and institutional embeddedness) and the actor's intrinsic properties (ability, and motivation based on internalized norms and benevolence) that form the basis of trustworthy behavior. Our analysis provides a frame of reference for the design of studies on trust in technology-mediated interactions, as well as a guide for identifying trust requirements in design processes. We demonstrate the application of the framework in three scenarios: call centre interactions, B2C e-commerce, and voice-enabled on-line gaming.",,

Furthermore, the impact of the trust framework is analysed by observing the evolution of trust over time, the overhead such a framework generates, and its effectiveness in limiting non-cooperation and malicious intent.",,
A framework for trust in construction contracting,A trust framework in construction contracting can enhance trust-building.,Search,2008,179,"Wei Kei Wong, Sai On Cheung, Tak Wing Yiu, Hoi Yan Pang",,,10.1016/J.IJPROMAN.2007.11.004,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJPROMAN.2007.11.004,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cc4275b67f674318edbfa9b2a3aeda04f224f4d6,,"Abstract How trust establishes and sustains relationship has been widely studied in the fields of social science, economics, business and management. It has been suggested that trust helps to reinforce individuals’ affirmative willingness, confidence, expectation, belief, behavior and to overcome risk/uncertainty. However, trust building has been considered as impossibility due to the divergent interests of the contracting parties. As such, implementing trust in construction contracting has gained limited progress. This study aims to first conceptualize trust in construction by categorizing trust types according to their development bases. Based on a review on previous studies on trust, three major types of trust are identified; system-based, cognition-based and affect-based. To enhance trust-building, these trust conceptions were further reduced to trusting behaviors. In this respect, a trust framework in construction contracting was developed and tested empirically by the technique of structural equation modeling. The correlations of these three forms of trust in construction contracting are significant and close, with the coefficients of 0.99, 0.97 and 0.94 for cognition-based, system-based and affect-based, respectively. These support the statistical fit of the proposed trust framework in construction contracting. The empirical results suggested that all three forms are of almost equal importance in trust building. This reinforces the conventional wise down that trust building is easy to say than do. The three facets of trust co-exist and in factual are mutually dependent. A system is only as good as its weakest point, hence a trust building project manager must be able to install robust system, care for the stakeholders and team members. The trust framework thus enhances our outstanding how trust building can be practiced in construction contracting.",,Review

We then investigate principled techniques for how the information present in our distrust model can be aggregated to produce individual measures of how trustworthy an agent is considered to be by a society.",,

Trust is used as a criteria for service selection. The first step to build a trust solution is to define trust and trust principles. Most current trust-based service selection approaches do not define trust and they establish trust for services by ranking services or finding the services' compliance and reputation. In addition, most studies do not consider trust principles that underpin trust concepts and do not address trust challenges that should be resolved as a part of the trust solution. This paper proposes a framework to build trust for services and to select services based on trust criteria. The main purpose is to move towards a unified framework that includes the main trust components to have a complete trust solution based on trust definition and trust principles.",,

Those different organizations might have their policies. Security is still a big concern in cloud computing. To help cloud vendors and customers to detect and prevent from being affected by potential attacks, we propose a trust management framework. We consider link/flow’s level trust, node’s level trust, and task/mission’s level trust. We introduced a new security metric trustability (trust–reliability) and a new algorithm to calculate it. Trustability measures how much a system can be trusted under a specific attack vector. Trustability can be used to explore the design space of resource configuration in order be able to choose the right trade-off between trustability and cost of redundancy. We show that our trust management framework can guide the administrators and customers to make decisions. For example, based on the real-time trust information, cloud administrators can migrate tasks from suspect nodes to trustworthy nodes, dynamically allocate a resource, and manage the trade-off between the degree of redundancy and the cost of the resource.",,
A trust framework for multi-organization environments,,Search,2014,,Khalifa  Toumi,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e102b5dc4f541961aba8265b24ca5e6167aba49d,,"The widespread of inexpensive communication technologies, distributed data storage and web services mechanisms currently urge the collaboration among organizations. Partners are participating in this environment motivated by several advantages such as: (1) the ability to use external and professional resources, services and knowledge, (2) the reduction of time-consuming requirements and (3) the benefaction of experts experience. However, this collaboration is not perfect since several problems can arise such as the misuse of resources, disclosure of data or inadequate services. Therefore, security is an important concern of the participants. In particular trust management and access control are one of the major security issues for an organization. This thesis addresses these two areas in particular. It proposes a novel and comprehensive trust framework for Multi-Organization Environments. Our approach is organized in four parts. First, we propose a vector based model approach for defining trust vectors. These vectors evaluate a set of requirements, under conditions, and provide a degree of confidence. In our approach, we consider two different types of vectors. On the one hand, a vector that links a user to an organization and, on the other hand, a vector that links two organizations. We also show how these vectors are evaluated and shared among the different organizations, and how we combine the provided trust information in order to enhance the security. Second, the TRUST-OrBAC model was designed to add the previous trust approach to the ORBAC model. Moreover, this solution was applied with a real collaboration network between companies. Third, we present a trust ontology methodology based on access control concepts. This ontology will be used to share the trust beliefs between participants and to make equivalence between their trust objectives. How to define this trust relationship, how to understand the trust objective of a requester, and how to evaluate the recommendation value is addressed in this thesis. Fourth, we improve our work by designing a passive testing approach in order to evaluate the behavior of a user. This contribution is based on the monitoring tool MMT. Finally the entire architecture of our system is proposed",,

The dynamic nature of these utility networks introduce challenging management and security issues due to behavior turnabout, maliciousness and diverse policy enforcement. The trust management approach offers interesting answers to such issues. In our framework, the lower layer computes local reputation for peers within their domain based on individual contribution, while the upper layer combines the local reputation with that of its domain's (as perceived by other domains) to compute the peer's global trust. Simulation results show that the hierarchical scheme is more scalable, highly robust in hostile conditions and capable of creating rapid trust estimates. Features of the framework include: (a) ability to carry forward local behavior trends, (b) autonomous domain-based policing, (c) high cohesiveness with the resource management system, and (d) securely exposing the trust evaluation operations to peers (i.e., the subjects of the evaluation process). A detailed analysis of the threats/attacks that the framework could be subjected is presented along with countermeasures against the attacks.",,

Requirements relating to trust are seen from many different perspectives by different stakeholders, and often expressed in different terms. There is therefore a need for a common framework or language, which will support a shared understanding of the concept of trust, and which will allow the requirements of different stakeholders to be discussed in common terms [6].",,
Trust Based Authorization Framework for Grid Services,,Search,2011,17,Sarbjeet  Singh,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7ead6d0787bfbb1f5465359e12798b90bd131b0e,,"Grid computing allows sharing of services and resources distributed over geographically dispersed, heterogeneous, autonomous administrative domains. As a domain generally has no idea about the trustworthiness of other domains, it may hesitate in accessing shared services and resources provided by other domains. Accessing resources and services from untrusted domains may pose dangerous consequences to the source domain. Trust is an important parameter in achieving faithful domain to domain interaction. Domains must be able to determine the trustworthiness of each other for the access of a particular service. Domains must also provide trust based access to resources and services that they expose in the environment. This paper describes different facets associated with trust issues among different entities in a grid environment and proposes a trust model to establish and manage trust relationships. The trust model provides support to calculate direct as well as recommended trust. Based on this model, a trust based authorization framework is proposed that can be used to provide trust based access to grid services. The goal of the model is to encourage trust based domain to domain interaction and increase the confidence of domains in accessing shared resources provided by other domains. The framework has been implemented in . NET environment with the support of WSE 3.0 toolkit. The framework has been evaluated by implementing a scenario that involves enforcement of different trust policies. The time taken by the enforcement component to evaluate trust policies has been noted. The results obtained from the implementation imply that the approach is workable and can be used to provide trust based access to grid services.",,

Other important issues like privacy, provenance and confidentiality also pose challenges. In this work, we propose a distributed trust framework that allows organizations to share data while adhering to the restrictions, thus enabling collaborations. The framework limits data publishing and access within semantic boundaries called ""worlds"" and provides scalable access-control mechanisms based on user credentials over the worlds. In this paper, we address the problem of distributing such a framework across several organizations, without compromising on the logic of data specification and trusted access control.",,

Trust relations are based on evidence created by the previous interactions of entities within a protocol. In this work, we are focusing on the evaluation of trust evidence in ad hoc networks. Because of the dynamic nature of ad hoc networks, trust evidence may be uncertain and incomplete. Also, no preestablished infrastructure can be assumed. The evaluation process is modeled as a path problem on a directed graph, where nodes represent entities, and edges represent trust relations. We give intuitive requirements and discuss design issues for any trust evaluation algorithm. Using the theory of semirings, we show how two nodes can establish an indirect trust relation without previous direct interaction. We show that our semiring framework is flexible enough to express other trust models, most notably PGP's Web of Trust. Our scheme is shown to be robust in the presence of attackers.",,
