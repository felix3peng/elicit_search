Trust and Stakeholder Theory: Trustworthiness in the Organisation–Stakeholder Relationship,Organizational trustworthiness may make relations fair for low-power stakeholders.,Search,2010,196,"Michelle  Greenwood, Harry J. Buren III",,,10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7efca319d03e872333b9a7d7e0c60c6527b02522,,"Trust is a fundamental aspect of the moral treatment of stakeholders within the organization–stakeholder relationship. Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,
Managing images of trustworthiness in organizations,Perceived trustworthiness is an important factor in engendering people's willingness to subject themselves to the actions of others.,Search,2004,49,Kimberly D. Elsbach,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30862b8cd95369f737447b6981eb8c618f99d605,,"Author(s): Elsbach, KD | Abstract: To possess an image of interpersonal trustworthiness is to be perceived by others as displaying (now and in the future) competence, benevolence, and integrity in one's behaviors and beliefs (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995; Mayer and Davis 1999). In this definition, interpersonal trustworthiness is defined as a perception of trustworthiness from and about social interactions. In a corporate context, competence refers to the abilities and skills that allow a manager to have power and influence in the organization, benevolence refers to a manager's desire to do good on behalf of organizational members, and integrity refers to a manager's adherence to principles or ideals that an organization's members find acceptable. This definition is based on recent frameworks which define trust as ""a willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another party."" (Mayer and Davis 1999, 124). That is, where trust is defined as a willingness or intent to submit to the actions of another, trustworthiness is defined as a perception that a trusted person, a trustee, will exhibit specific behaviors that commonly engender a willingness to submit to that person's actions. These definitions of trust and trustworthiness are supported by recent research that identifies both motivation and ability as bases of trust in organizations (Mishra 1996; Brockner and Siegel 1996), and uses the components of intention and belief to define trust (McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany 1998).1 Such definitions seem particularly appropriate in managerial settings, where trust often means submitting to the direction of leaders with little knowledge about the consequences of those directions. In such risky or ambiguous situations, perceived trustworthiness has been shown to be an important factor in engendering people's willingness to subject themselves to the actions of others (Kramer and Tyler 1996). For example, F. David Schoorman, Roger C. Mayer, and James H. Davis (1996) found that perceived trustworthiness in a staff member contributed significantly to a veterinarian's willingness to delegate to that staff member risky tasks such as administering anesthesia. Similarly, in a fourteenmonth field study of management performance appraisal systems, Mayer and Davis (1999) found that enhancing perceived benevolence, integrity, and competence by means of implementing a new performance appraisal system increased employees ""willingness to let top management have control over"" employee and organizational well-being.

Trustworthiness criteria for supporting users to assess the credibility of web information,Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information.,Search,2013,21,"Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai, Kieron  O'Hara, Wendy  Hall",WWW '13 Companion,,10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://doi.org/10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9adf6b120bcb40e317160baed50cbbdb791931af,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful. Moreover, we obtain weighting scores for criteria which can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of information and suggest a piece of information that is more likely to be trustworthy to Web users.",,Review
Trustworthiness,Trustworthiness is an epistemic desideratum.,Search,2008,130,Catherine Z.

It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,
Trustworthiness and trust: influences and implications,"Trust operates at two levels in services relationships, with a number of key drivers that are mediated by trustworthiness.",Search,2014,109,"Harjit  Sekhon, Christine  Ennew, Husni  Kharouf, James F.

Our findings are supported by survey data from customers of UK financial services, with the data points captured over a number of years which allow for fluctuations in trust level. Empirically we find that trustworthiness impacts both the cognitive and affecting dimensions of trust, with the impact being greatest on cognitive trust. As a result of our findings it is possible for practitioner to implement policies to not only build trust but also deal with issues where there is a need to rebuild it, as in the case of our research setting.",,

What is trustworthiness and what drives it?,Vulnerability-responsiveness is an important determinant of trustworthiness even when the vulnerability of the trustor does not come with a gift for the trustee.,Search,2016,50,"James C.

Our results indicate that -- besides unconditional other-regarding preferences -- vulnerability-responsiveness is an important determinant of trustworthiness even in cases where the vulnerability of the trustor does not come together with a gift to the trustee. Motivated by our empirical findings we provide formal definitions of trust and trustworthiness based on revealed willingness to accept vulnerability and the response to it.",,
Trustworthiness Attributes and Metrics for Engineering Trusted Internet-Based Software Systems,"Trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference.",Search,2013,35,"Nazila Gol Mohammadi, Sachar  Paulus, Mohamed  Bishr, Andreas  Metzger, Holger  Könnecke, Sandro  Hartenstein, Thorsten  Weyer, Klaus  Pohl",CLOSER,,10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8458fc0ecbc37aa30756cbc4c9d4d708475ccf58,,"Trustworthiness of Internet-based software systems, apps, services and platform is a key success factor for their use and acceptance by organizations and end-users.

As one main contribution, we present an extensive list of software quality attributes that contribute to trustworthiness. Those software quality attributes have been identified by a systematic review of the research literature and by analyzing two real-world use cases. As a second contribution, we sketch an approach for systematically deriving metrics to measure the trustworthiness of software system. Our work thereby contributes to better understanding which software quality attributes should be considered and assured when engineering trustworthy Internet-based software systems.",,Systematic Review
Trustworthiness,Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments.,Search,2019,1,Katherine  Hawley,How To Be Trustworthy,,10.1093/oso/9780198843900.003.0004,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198843900.003.0004,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6083a97b5fc6e72b366fb1c2dd0e8349cd301045,,"This chapter explains the account of trustworthiness and untrustworthiness which fits the commitment account of trust and distrust. Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,

The Significance of Group Trustworthiness We value trustworthiness where we find it, in friends, colleagues, and strangers.

This preference for trustworthiness over untrustworthiness is not limited to our interactions with individuals.

The study draws on interview data from 3 focus groups with experienced users of the Washington State Digital Archives. Utilizing thematic analysis and micro‐interlocutor analysis to examine a combination of interview transcripts and video recordings, the study provides a realistic picture of the strength and character of emergent themes that underpin the more general concept of trustworthiness.

To address this problem, we propose a systematic method for assessing the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses the data provenance as well as their values in computing trust scores, that is, quantitative measures of trustworthiness. To obtain trust scores, we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependency property: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that created and manipulated the data, and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed from their value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the principle that ""the more similar values for the same event, the higher the trust scores"". The provenance similarity is based on the principle that ""the more different data provenances with similar values, the higher the trust scores"". Experimental results show that our approach provides a practical solution for trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks.",,

Trust and Trustworthiness,Trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of relationships.,Search,2018,279,"Özalp  Özer, Yanchong  Zheng",The Handbook of Behavioral Operations,,10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f05c70163160b4ec3b1a8cfc2ff0e87e50b943c7,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/120755/1/SSRN-id3046303.pdf,"In this chapter, we discuss when, how, and why trust and trustworthiness arise to support cooperation within and across organizations. To do so, we first define trust and trustworthiness, discuss how they can be quantified and determine key components of trusting and trustworthy behavior. In addition, we identify building blocks of trust and trustworthiness and offer tangible insights about how to establish trusting and cooperative business/inter-organizational relationships, based on both academic research and case studies from across industries. We all know that trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of our relationships, business or otherwise. Our friends, foes, family, colleagues, sociologists, management scientists, and even economists recognize this fact (even though some may not acknowledge it). We innately believe being trustworthy is a virtue (or, at least, are taught to think so) and have learned whether and when to trust (to the best of our abilities). And when we trust, we put ourselves in a vulnerable situation (i.e., we take a risk) based upon the expectation that the person we trusted (trustee) behaves in a positive way that is rewarding to us (as trustors). So, we make a risky “investment” of some sort and face uncertainty in the outcome (and may even regret later) when we trust. We also perhaps adjust our trusting and trustworthy behavior depending on the target of our trust, given the relevant context. For example, we may trust our significant other that he or she will return the $250 (or the car) we lend him or her (perhaps with an implicit or explicit expectation of a positive return beyond the actual loan). We probably would not ask him or her to write a contract before lending our car. However, most of us would perhaps require a marriage certificate (a binding contract that can only be annulled after a legal hearing) accepting all requirements governing a marriage before we commit “to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part...” and ensure that we provide and receive the care and commitment in the presence of conflicting objectives that we will all face during our marriage. Similarly, most successful business and economic relationships are built upon a considerable degree of mutual trust and trustworthiness. As Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow wrote, “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust” (Arrow 1972). Trust has been the glue for most transactions within and across cultures as long as humans have socialized and transacted. Business owners and practitioners are not oblivious to this fact. They do not begin talking with a potential partner by first writing a complete set of contracts stipulating all 1 Note that you neither need a marriage certificate nor need to rely on trust if (the big if) your spouse’s and your objectives are and will be perfectly aligned with absolutely no uncertainty 100% of the time during the span of your life. Similarly, in such a case, there is no need for a preor post-nuptial agreement.",,

This paper focuses on exploring an efficient context-aware trustworthiness inference framework to address this issue. Based on the sociological and psychological principles of trust generation between human beings, the proposed framework divides trust into two types: familiarity trust and similarity trust. The familiarity trust can be calculated by direct trust and recommendation trust, while the similarity trust can be calculated based on external similarity trust and internal similarity trust. We subsequently present concrete methods for the calculation of different trust elements. In particular, we design a kernel-based nonlinear multivariate grey prediction model to predict the direct trust of a specific object, which acts as the core module of the entire framework. Besides, considering the fuzziness and uncertainty in the concept of trust, we introduce the fuzzy logic method to synthesize these trust elements. The experimental results verify the validity of the core module and the resistance to attacks of this framework.",,

The view on trust in this thesis involves viewpoints on what stakeholders can have trust in, and the need to exhibit and suggest trustworthiness in online services. Trustworthiness and other relevant theories are also discussed. Three main results supporting design and maintenance of trustworthy online services will be introduced. First, a trust framework in the context of online services is introduced, specifying a number of concepts that enhances and clarifies how trust can be addressed. The framework enables an informed analysis, implementation, and assessment of solutions to trust issues based on identified trust concerns. Secondly we present how the concepts of the framework can be interconnected. The concepts enables us to reason about stakeholders trust concerns in relation to deployable solutions called trust mechanisms that are implemented in order to exhibit proper signs suggesting trustworthiness. These signs, we argue, serve as input for stakeholders trust assessment. The interconnected framework opens up for a discussion on how deployed solutions in an online service correspond to certain stakeholders trust concerns. Finally a tool for online service designers is presented, the trust management life cycle. This is an approach enabling an informed design practice that emphasizes on a trustworthy design of online services. The use of the cycle is illustrated by the use of a deployed online service.",,

We are developing new methods for the rigorous design of trustworthy software systems with predictable, provable, and ultimately legally certifiable system properties. We are well aware that it is impossible to build completely error-free complex software systems. We therefore complement fault-prevention and fault-removal techniques with fault-tolerance methods that introduce redundancy and diversity into software systems. Quantifiable attributes such as availability, reliability, and performance call for analytical prediction models, which require empirical studies for calibration and validation. To consider the legal aspects of software certification and liability, TrustSoft integrates the disciplines of computer science and computer law.",,
A Framework for Trustworthiness Assessment based on Fidelity in Cyber and Physical Domains,A method for the assessment of trust for n-open systems based on a measurement of fidelity.,Search,2015,8,"Vincenzo De Florio, Giuseppe  Primiero",ANT/SEIT,,10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.092,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2015.05.092,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c64b85659445853a965d0ba3c9590b0d284e92a,https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/16805/1/1-s2.0-S1877050915008923-main.pdf,We introduce a method for the assessment of trust for n-open systems based on a measurement of fidelity and present a prototypical implementation of a complaint architecture. We construct a MAPE loop which monitors the compliance between corresponding figures of interest in cyber- and physical domains; derive measures of the system's trustworthiness; and use them to plan and execute actions aiming at guaranteeing system safety and resilience. We conclude with a view on our future work.,,
Who Is Trustworthy? Predicting Trustworthy Intentions and Behavior,People high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than individuals who are low in guilt-proneness.,Search,2018,46,"Emma E Levine, T Bradford Bitterly, Taya R Cohen, Maurice E Schweitzer",Journal of personality and social psychology,,10.1037/pspi0000136,https://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000136,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a98cdff7b61bbc874d2185a665d25ba9bb3eb434,https://psyarxiv.com/w6zvf/download,"Existing trust research has disproportionately focused on what makes people more or less trusting, and has largely ignored the question of what makes people more or less trustworthy. In this investigation, we deepen our understanding of trustworthiness. Across six studies using economic games that measure trustworthy behavior and survey items that measure trustworthy intentions, we explore the personality traits that predict trustworthiness. We demonstrate that guilt-proneness predicts trustworthiness better than a variety of other personality measures, and we identify sense of interpersonal responsibility as the underlying mechanism by both measuring it and manipulating it directly. People who are high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than are individuals who are low in guilt-proneness, but they are not universally more generous. We demonstrate that people high in guilt-proneness are more likely to behave in interpersonally sensitive ways when they are more responsible for others’ outcomes. We also explore potential interventions to increase trustworthiness. Our findings fill a significant gap in the trust literature by building a foundation for investigating trustworthiness, by identifying a trait predictor of trustworthy intentions and behavior, and by providing practical advice for deciding in whom we should place our trust.",,
Ontology-Based Modeling and Analysis of Trustworthiness Requirements: Preliminary Results,The requirements for Artificial Intelligence systems to be trusted by their users require new techniques.,Search,2020,4,"Glenda C. M. Amaral, Renata S. S. Guizzardi, Giancarlo  Guizzardi, John  Mylopoulos",ER,,10.1007/978-3-030-62522-1_25,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-62522-1_25,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03e16747ded22031ff0d7d9e8e67ca560b7fed4c,,"The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has made it possible to build systems that diagnose a patient, decide on a loan application, drive a car, or kill an adversary in combat. Such systems signal a new era where software-intensive systems perform tasks that were performed in the past only by humans because they require judgement that only humans possess. However, such systems need to be trusted by their users, in the same way that a lawyer, medical doctor, driver or soldier is trusted in performing the tasks she is trained for. This creates the need for a new class of requirements, Trustworthiness Requirements, that we have to study in order to develop techniques for their elicitation, analysis and operationalization. In this paper, we propose a foundation to develop such techniques. Our work is based on an Ontology of Trust that answers questions about the nature of trust and the factors that influence it. Based on the answers, we characterize the class of trustworthiness requirements. Among other things, this characterization supports the requirements engineer in defining thurstworthiness requirements, identifying the risks presented by the system-to-be, and understanding the signals the system must emit to gain and maintain trust.",,
