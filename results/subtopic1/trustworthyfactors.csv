Incredible: is (almost) all web content trustworthy? analysis of psychological factors related to website credibility evaluation,People characterized by high general trust tend to be more generous in their credibility evaluations.,Search,2014,27,"Maria  Rafalak, Katarzyna  Abramczuk, Adam  Wierzbicki",WWW,,10.1145/2567948.2578997,https://doi.org/10.1145/2567948.2578997,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/af9b45d07e5e9e0378398b80bf2722597d7179c0,,"This paper describes the results of a study conducted in February 2013 on Amazon Mechanical Turk aimed at identifying various determinants of credibility evaluations. 2046 adult participants evaluated credibility of websites with diversified trustworthiness reference index. We concentrated on psychological factors that lead to the characteristic positive bias observed in many working social feedback systems on the Internet. We have used International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and measured the following traits: trust, conformity, risk taking, need for cognition and intellect. Results suggest that trustworthiness and risk taking are factors clearly differentiating people with respect to tendency to overestimate, underestimate and judge accordingly websites' credibility. Intuitively people characterized by high general trust tend to be more generous in their credibility evaluations. On the other hand, people who are more willing to take risk, tend to be more critical of the Internet content. The latter indicates that high credibility evaluations are being treated as a default option, and lower ratings require special conditions. Other, more detailed psychological patterns related to websites' credibility evaluations are described in full paper.",,
Factors of trust that influence trust worthiness in peer-to-peer (P2P) based e-commerce,Trust can be assigned to a peer in a peer-to-peer system based on various factors.,Search,2004,7,"Farookh Khadeer Hussain, Elizabeth  Chang, Tharam S.

As a result, electronic commerce will be carried out over the peer-to-peer systems in the future rather than in a client-server environment.

In this paper, we propose the factors that can influence the trustworthiness assigned to the trusted peer. Furthermore we catalogue these factors into three classes and discuss the relationship between these factors.",,
Trustworthiness Attributes and Metrics for Engineering Trusted Internet-Based Software Systems,"Trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference.",Search,2013,35,"Nazila Gol Mohammadi, Sachar  Paulus, Mohamed  Bishr, Andreas  Metzger, Holger  Könnecke, Sandro  Hartenstein, Thorsten  Weyer, Klaus  Pohl",CLOSER,,10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8458fc0ecbc37aa30756cbc4c9d4d708475ccf58,,"Trustworthiness of Internet-based software systems, apps, services and platform is a key success factor for their use and acceptance by organizations and end-users. The notion of trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference, e.g., organizations require confidence about how their business critical data is handled whereas end-users may be more concerned about usability. As one main contribution, we present an extensive list of software quality attributes that contribute to trustworthiness. Those software quality attributes have been identified by a systematic review of the research literature and by analyzing two real-world use cases. As a second contribution, we sketch an approach for systematically deriving metrics to measure the trustworthiness of software system. Our work thereby contributes to better understanding which software quality attributes should be considered and assured when engineering trustworthy Internet-based software systems.",,Systematic Review
What makes websites trustworthy?

In the internet commerce environment, people do business by interacting with a customer interface which, in this case, is an internet vendor's website. Thus, websites must be designed carefully to induce feelings of trust on the part of the customer, which will influence the decision to buy from a specific vendor. The objective of this research was to identify website design features that have significant effect on customer trust in internet shopping. A two-phase empirical study was conducted. In Phase I, respondents were asked to rate the importance of various website design features in terms of their trust for internet shopping. Forty six features were identified and grouped into nine categories. In Phase II, a different group of respondents were asked to decide whether each of these 46 features and nine categories was a Hygiene factor (i.e., a 'must have' factor, without which a customer would certainly feel distrustful), or a Motivator (i.e., a 'good to have' factor, without which a customer would not feel distrustful, but which, if present, could increase the customer's perception of trustworthiness).",,
Trustworthiness criteria for supporting users to assess the credibility of web information,"The normative trustworthiness criteria, authority, currency, accuracy, and relevance can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information.",Search,2013,21,"Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai, Kieron  O'Hara, Wendy  Hall",WWW '13 Companion,,10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://doi.org/10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9adf6b120bcb40e317160baed50cbbdb791931af,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful. Moreover, we obtain weighting scores for criteria which can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of information and suggest a piece of information that is more likely to be trustworthy to Web users.",,Review
Improving trust using online credibility sources and social network quality in P2P marketplaces,"A trust model improves trust between users, normally in the context of p2p transactions, based on online credibility sources and social network quality metrics.",Search,2013,11,"Mauro  Nunes, Joao  Correia",2013 8th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI),,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4b1f97ff9685e7d759a9c139f859d152171ab84d,,"In p2p marketplaces, users often have to decide if someone is trustworthy or not. Sometimes, this decision is based purely on faith, which is something not everyone is willing to do. For this reason, trust has been identified as one of the key factors for the success of the sharing economy. Over the years trust mechanisms have been developed on a per site basis (i.e. feedback, voting or reputation systems) and users have been slowly building trust in these sites and leaving a reputation trail as they move from site to site. This process should be more efficient and users must be able to use the hard earned reputation to show they are trustworthy. To this end, we present a trust model for improving trust between users, normally in the context of p2p transactions, based on online credibility sources and social network quality metrics. In this paper we formally define a multi-dimensional trust model adapted to p2p marketplaces, introduce WhyTrusted.com prototype as a proof-of-concept that is able to capture, process, and translate data into relevant dimensions of the trust model to measure a person's perceived trustworthiness with a portable, cross-platform trust score, and use an empirical analysis to confirm that the WhyTrusted trust score and source ratings improve a user's propensity to trust.",,

This is because it is easier to cooperate with trustworthy individuals than with untrustworthy ones, but also because trustworthiness is appreciated for its own sake. Conversely, we resent untrustworthiness when we encounter it, and try to minimise interaction with untrustworthy individuals. This preference for trustworthiness over untrustworthiness is not limited to our interactions with individuals. Who wouldn’t prefer to work for a trustworthy company, to be treated at a trustworthy hospital, and to vote for a trustworthy political party?",,
Factors of Trusting in International Business,"Trusting as action signals the possibility of individual choices, new decisions and the potential for building more meaningful relationships.",Search,2007,1,"K.

The survey was open to all nationalities and asked a broad variety of questions regarding individual choices of trusting.

The authors give a brief overview of trust in different disciplines and argue that defining trust as an action provides a new platform for examining our relationships inside and outside organisations. Trusting as action signals the possibility of individual choices, new decisions and the potential for building more meaningful relationships.

This paper identifies a set of factors that can form a basis for personal reflection and also provide a starting point for an organisational review of relationships in the workplace. Such a review is particularly valuable when members of the organisation come from different cultural background. Understanding our factors of trusting is the first step towards appreciating the needs of others in long term relationship building.

The authors suggest that a more in depth survey could ascertain the validity of this pilot study. Understanding our own factors of trusting will enable us to recognise and accommodate the needs of others and build trusting relationships both in national and in international business.",,Review

The existence of trustworthiness is shown through qualities like being respectful, honest, consistent, positive, and selfless. Leaders who can admit mistakes, acknowledge weakness, applaud strength, and help each other, and who can promote those qualities in the workforce, will be capable of building trust. Mutual trust is important, and everyone has a lot at stake with trust issues because of the inherent risks. Those risks are about putting one's faith or a pending decision in the hands of someone in whom you have not yet developed confidence in, or in whom there are limits to that confidence. Leaders who follow telework policies developed in response to COVID-19 must build trust with subordinates and superiors alike. Trust can then grow as emotions are shared, real understanding developed, and core issues are addressed professionally.",,

Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,

It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,

The level of uncertainty and the nature of what is at stake affect the risks involved in a given interaction situation. Furthermore, the mechanisms that are put in place to help individuals assess the trustworthiness of others typically vary according to the levels of uncertainty and risk in the setting. As it becomes progressively more common to interact and engage in exchanges using computer-mediated communication systems such as the Internet, the anonymity of individuals and the reduction in available social cues increase the risks as well as the possibilities for misjudging trustworthiness and thus increase the possibilities for significant loss or even harm. In this chapter we examine the factors that individuals use when determining the trustworthiness of exchange partners who provide either goods or services in online environments. Following current theory and research, we argue that the competence and motivations of the exchange partner are two key bases of individuals’ inferences about trustworthiness, particularly when there are no third-party or credible institutional devices in place to reduce uncertainty and manage risk. However, we demonstrate that the effects of competence and motivation have different relative degrees of importance in online goods markets compared to online service markets. We present the results of an exploratory study designed to examine how individuals assess the trustworthiness of others in online markets for goods and services.",,

Guba’s constructs, in particular, have won considerable favour and form the focus of this paper. Here researchers seek to satisfy four criteria. In addressing credibility, investigators attempt to demonstrate that a true picture of the phenomenon under scrutiny is being presented. To allow transferability, they provide sufficient detail of the context of the fieldwork for a reader to be able to decide whether the prevailing environment is similar to another situation with which he or she is familiar and whether the findings can justifiably be applied to the other setting. The meeting of the dependability criterion is difficult in qualitative work, although researchers should at least strive to enable a future investigator to repeat the study. Finally, to achieve confirmability, researchers must take steps to demonstrate that findings emerge from the data and not their own predispositions. The paper concludes by suggesting that it is the responsibility of research methods teachers to ensure that this or a comparable model for ensuring trustworthiness is followed by students undertaking a qualitative inquiry.",,

For example, we may rely on our car starting to get to work on time, and on our fellow drivers, so that we may get there safely. For similar reasons, trust is becoming increasingly important in computing, as systems, such as the Grid, require integration of computing resources, across organisational boundaries. In this context, the reliability of resources in one organisation cannot be assumed from the point of view of another, as certain resources may fail more often than others. For this reason, we argue that software systems must be able to assess the reliability of different resources, so that they may choose which of them to rely on. With this in mind, our goal is to develop mechanisms, or models, to aid decision making by an autonomous agent (the truster), when the consequences of its decisions depend on the actions of other agents (the trustees). To achieve this, we have developed a probabilistic framework for assessing trust based on a trustee's past behaviour, which we have instantiated through the creation of two novel trust models (TRAVOS and TRAVOS-C). These facilitate decision making in two different contexts with regard to trustee behaviour. First, using TRAVOS, a truster can make decisions in contexts where a trustee can only act in one of two ways: either it can cooperate, acting to the truster's advantage; or it can defect, thereby acting against the truster's interests. Second, using TRAVOS-C, a truster can make decisions about trustees that can act in a continuous range of ways, for example, taking into account the delivery time of a service. These models share an ability to account for observations of a trustee's behaviour, made either directly by the truster, or by a third party (reputation source). In the latter case, both models can cope with third party information that is unreliable, either because the sender is lying, or because it has a different world view. In addition, TRAVOS-C can assess a trustee for which there is little or no direct or reported experience, using information about other agents that share characteristics with the trustee. This is achieved using a probabilistic mechanism, which automatically accounts for the amount of correlation observed between agents' behaviour, in a truster's environment.",,
