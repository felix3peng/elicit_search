Factors of trust that influence trust worthiness in peer-to-peer (P2P) based e-commerce,Trust between two interacting peers involved in an electronic transaction is one of the problems P2P systems suffer from.,Search,2004,7,"Farookh Khadeer Hussain, Elizabeth  Chang, Tharam S. Dillon",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/49f6bd371f7dbd663fa6a5da0c3b4235190cec62,,"Peer-to-Peer Systems are becoming popular. They are widely regarded as the nextgeneration of the Internet. As a result, electronic commerce will be carried out over the peer-to-peer systems in the future rather than in a client-server environment. These Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems suffer from innumerable problems. Trust between two interacting peers involved in an electronic transaction is one of them. In this paper, we propose the factors that can influence the trustworthiness assigned to the trusted peer. Furthermore we catalogue these factors into three classes and discuss the relationship between these factors.",,
Trustworthiness criteria for supporting users to assess the credibility of web information,"Normative criteria such as authority, currency, accuracy, and relevance can be used to assess the trustworthiness of Web information.",Search,2013,21,"Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai, Kieron  O'Hara, Wendy  Hall",WWW '13 Companion,,10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://doi.org/10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9adf6b120bcb40e317160baed50cbbdb791931af,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful. Moreover, we obtain weighting scores for criteria which can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of information and suggest a piece of information that is more likely to be trustworthy to Web users.",,Review
Trustworthiness Attributes and Metrics for Engineering Trusted Internet-Based Software Systems,"Trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference.",Search,2013,35,"Nazila Gol Mohammadi, Sachar  Paulus, Mohamed  Bishr, Andreas  Metzger, Holger  Könnecke, Sandro  Hartenstein, Thorsten  Weyer, Klaus  Pohl",CLOSER,,10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-11561-0_2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8458fc0ecbc37aa30756cbc4c9d4d708475ccf58,,"Trustworthiness of Internet-based software systems, apps, services and platform is a key success factor for their use and acceptance by organizations and end-users. The notion of trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference, e.g., organizations require confidence about how their business critical data is handled whereas end-users may be more concerned about usability. As one main contribution, we present an extensive list of software quality attributes that contribute to trustworthiness. Those software quality attributes have been identified by a systematic review of the research literature and by analyzing two real-world use cases. As a second contribution, we sketch an approach for systematically deriving metrics to measure the trustworthiness of software system. Our work thereby contributes to better understanding which software quality attributes should be considered and assured when engineering trustworthy Internet-based software systems.",,Systematic Review
What is trustworthiness and what drives it?,Vulnerability-responsiveness is an important determinant of trustworthiness even when the vulnerability of the trustor does not come with a gift for the trustee.,Search,2016,50,"James C.

Our results indicate that -- besides unconditional other-regarding preferences -- vulnerability-responsiveness is an important determinant of trustworthiness even in cases where the vulnerability of the trustor does not come together with a gift to the trustee. Motivated by our empirical findings we provide formal definitions of trust and trustworthiness based on revealed willingness to accept vulnerability and the response to it.",,

We examine behavioral and survey measures and conclude that the amount sent in the trust game is a good, albeit partial and overreaching, measure of one facet of trust. Common survey measures of trusting capture well other facets of trusting. The proportion sent back in the trust game represents well trustworthiness in the specific context in which it was developed, an investment situation, but falls short in capturing other facets of trustworthiness. The Machiavellian scale appears to be a weak measure of any facets of trustworthiness. Gender is the primary determinant of investment-related facet of trusting, and personality is a strong determinant of other facets. One personality trait - agreeableness - explains investment-related trustworthiness.",,

Our findings are supported by survey data from customers of UK financial services, with the data points captured over a number of years which allow for fluctuations in trust level. Empirically we find that trustworthiness impacts both the cognitive and affecting dimensions of trust, with the impact being greatest on cognitive trust. As a result of our findings it is possible for practitioner to implement policies to not only build trust but also deal with issues where there is a need to rebuild it, as in the case of our research setting.",,

Perceived trustworthiness of knowledge sources: the moderating impact of relationship length.,Relationship length does not directly affect perceived trustworthiness but moderates the association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other.,Search,2006,292,"Daniel Z Levin, Ellen M Whitener, Rob  Cross",The Journal of applied psychology,,10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1163,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1163,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aaccdac1dee04a08c94b8297ee0ecb70336ad638,http://www.levin.rutgers.edu/research/trust-bases-paper.pdf,"Prior meta-analytic evidence has indicated no association between relationship length and perceived trustworthiness. Viewing trustors as information processors, the authors propose a model in which relationship length, although having no direct effect on perceived trustworthiness, moderates the association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other. Specifically, as trustors learn about others, they base their trust on different kinds of information (demographic similarity, trustworthy behavior, and shared perspective). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of a field survey of supervisors and subordinates from 3 companies (N = 88) provide evidence consistent with this prediction: Perceived trustworthiness is associated with demographic similarity in newer relationships, with trustworthy behavior in relationships that are neither brand new nor old but in-between, and with shared perspective in older relationships.",,

After assessing the reliability and validity of this factor structure, the study also compares the five alternative models of trustworthiness. Results indicated that the trustworthiness model with the six first-order factors has the best model fit. Higher order confirmatory factor analysis was used to identify three second-order trustworthiness factors, which are competency, openness, and benevolence. The various dimensions of trustworthiness are viewable as levers of improving a bank's trustworthiness in the minds of its current and potential customers.",,
Managing images of trustworthiness in organizations,Perceived trustworthiness contributes to a willingness to submit to the actions of others.,Search,2004,49,Kimberly D. Elsbach,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30862b8cd95369f737447b6981eb8c618f99d605,,"Author(s): Elsbach, KD | Abstract: To possess an image of interpersonal trustworthiness is to be perceived by others as displaying (now and in the future) competence, benevolence, and integrity in one's behaviors and beliefs (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995; Mayer and Davis 1999). In this definition, interpersonal trustworthiness is defined as a perception of trustworthiness from and about social interactions. In a corporate context, competence refers to the abilities and skills that allow a manager to have power and influence in the organization, benevolence refers to a manager's desire to do good on behalf of organizational members, and integrity refers to a manager's adherence to principles or ideals that an organization's members find acceptable. This definition is based on recent frameworks which define trust as ""a willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another party."" (Mayer and Davis 1999, 124). That is, where trust is defined as a willingness or intent to submit to the actions of another, trustworthiness is defined as a perception that a trusted person, a trustee, will exhibit specific behaviors that commonly engender a willingness to submit to that person's actions. These definitions of trust and trustworthiness are supported by recent research that identifies both motivation and ability as bases of trust in organizations (Mishra 1996; Brockner and Siegel 1996), and uses the components of intention and belief to define trust (McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany 1998).1 Such definitions seem particularly appropriate in managerial settings, where trust often means submitting to the direction of leaders with little knowledge about the consequences of those directions. In such risky or ambiguous situations, perceived trustworthiness has been shown to be an important factor in engendering people's willingness to subject themselves to the actions of others (Kramer and Tyler 1996). For example, F. David Schoorman, Roger C. Mayer, and James H. Davis (1996) found that perceived trustworthiness in a staff member contributed significantly to a veterinarian's willingness to delegate to that staff member risky tasks such as administering anesthesia. Similarly, in a fourteenmonth field study of management performance appraisal systems, Mayer and Davis (1999) found that enhancing perceived benevolence, integrity, and competence by means of implementing a new performance appraisal system increased employees ""willingness to let top management have control over"" employee and organizational well-being.

The Significance of Group Trustworthiness We value trustworthiness where we find it, in friends, colleagues, and strangers. This is because it is easier to cooperate with trustworthy individuals than with untrustworthy ones, but also because trustworthiness is appreciated for its own sake. Conversely, we resent untrustworthiness when we encounter it, and try to minimise interaction with untrustworthy individuals. This preference for trustworthiness over untrustworthiness is not limited to our interactions with individuals.

This research investigated the relative importance, when purchasing goods and services over the Web, of four common trust indices (i.e. (1) third party privacy seals, (2) privacy statements, (3) third party security seals, and (4) security features). The results indicate consumers valued security features significantly more than the three other trust indices. We also investigated the relationship between these trust indices and the consumer's perceptions of a marketer's trustworthiness. The findings indicate that consumers' ratings of trustworthiness of Web merchants did not parallel experts' evaluation of sites' use of the trust indices. This study also examined the extent to which consumers are willing to provide private information to electronic and land merchants. The results revealed that when making the decision to provide private information, consumers rely on their perceptions of trustworthiness irrespective of whether the merchant is electronic only or land and electronic. Finally, we investigated the relative importance of three types of Web attributes: security, privacy and pleasure features (convenience, ease of use, cosmetics). Privacy and security features were of lesser importance than pleasure features when considering consumers' intention to purchase. A discussion of the implications of these results and an agenda for future research are provided.",,

Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,

It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,

Our meta-analysis of 132 independent samples summarized the relationships between the trust variables and both risk taking and job performance (task performance, citizenship behavior, counterproductive behavior). Meta-analytic structural equation modeling supported a partial mediation model wherein trustworthiness and trust propensity explained incremental variance in the behavioral outcomes when trust was controlled. Further analyses revealed that the trustworthiness dimensions also predicted affective commitment, which had unique relationships with the outcomes when controlling for trust. These results generalized across different types of trust measures (i.e., positive expectations measures, willingness-to-be-vulnerable measures, and direct measures) and different trust referents (i.e., leaders, coworkers).",,Meta-Analysis

We have used International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) and measured the following traits: trust, conformity, risk taking, need for cognition and intellect. Results suggest that trustworthiness and risk taking are factors clearly differentiating people with respect to tendency to overestimate, underestimate and judge accordingly websites' credibility. Intuitively people characterized by high general trust tend to be more generous in their credibility evaluations. On the other hand, people who are more willing to take risk, tend to be more critical of the Internet content. The latter indicates that high credibility evaluations are being treated as a default option, and lower ratings require special conditions.

This relationship between TWML and perceived outcomes is especially strong in low-performing agencies and in agencies experiencing increased uncertainty due to structural and upper level leadership changes. We draw two substantive conclusions from these empirical results. First, it is clear that the characteristics of managers matter for outcomes of public organizations. In particular, trustworthy managers preside over more productive organizations and are better able to maintain and even increase organizational outcomes in agencies challenged by low level of performance and perturbations in the external environment. Second, public managers and management scholars ought to view trust not only as an exogenous variable but also as a managerial resource to be cultivated.",,

Across six studies using economic games that measure trustworthy behavior and survey items that measure trustworthy intentions, we explore the personality traits that predict trustworthiness. We demonstrate that guilt-proneness predicts trustworthiness better than a variety of other personality measures, and we identify sense of interpersonal responsibility as the underlying mechanism by both measuring it and manipulating it directly. People who are high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than are individuals who are low in guilt-proneness, but they are not universally more generous. We demonstrate that people high in guilt-proneness are more likely to behave in interpersonally sensitive ways when they are more responsible for others’ outcomes. We also explore potential interventions to increase trustworthiness. Our findings fill a significant gap in the trust literature by building a foundation for investigating trustworthiness, by identifying a trait predictor of trustworthy intentions and behavior, and by providing practical advice for deciding in whom we should place our trust.",,

It is especially needed in the case of gaining and later retaining consumers of online vendors. This has been shown by previous research using single dimensional constructs. But trust can also be viewed as a multi-dimensional construct combining specific beliefs (sometimes labeled as trustworthiness) that either directly or through an overall assessment of trust influence relevant behavioral intentions. To show the need to examine trust in a multi-dimensional perspective, this study proposes a three-dimensional scale of trustworthiness dealing with integrity, benevolence, and ability in the unique case of online consumer trust, and then shows the importance of examining the effects of each dimension individually. The data show that trustworthiness and trust should not be regarded as a single construct with a single effect. Rather, different beliefs influence different consumer activity intentions. Window-shopping intentions was affected by the ability-trustworthiness of the vendor, while overall trust in the vendor and its integrity-trustworthiness affected purchase intentions. The importance of differentiating among online customer activities and what dimensions of trustworthiness affect each is discussed.",,
Organizational Trustworthiness: An International Perspective,"The established constructs of interpersonal trustworthiness, competence, legal compliance, responsibility to inform, quality assurance, procedural fairness, interpersonal courtesy, and financial balance are known for their varying perspectives and inconsistencies.",Search,2003,184,"Cam  Caldwell, Stephen E. Clapham",,,10.1023/A:1027370104302,https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1027370104302,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b35812f59de9647c93f2328e7398ce9253fa972,,"Although trust has been widely recognized as a vital component ofrelationships and a critical element to the success of organizations,the literature describing trust and trustworthiness is known for itsvarying perspectives and its inconsistencies. Trustworthiness has beenidentified as a condition precedent to the development of trust.Building upon the established constructs of interpersonaltrustworthiness, we propose a related model containing the sevenconstructs of Competence, Legal Compliance, Responsibility to Inform,Quality Assurance, Procedural Fairness, Interactional Cour-tesy, andFinancial Balance. Citing evidence from trust-related literature, weidentify the utility of these seven constructs in encompassingorganizational trustworthiness as a subjectively perceived aspect oforganizational effectiveness. We analyzed questionnaire data andconducted comparative world-region analyses.",,
"The Role of Trustworthiness in Reducing Transaction Costs and Improving Performance: Empirical Evidence from the United States, Japan, and Korea",Trustworthiness lowers transaction costs and may be an important source of competitive advantage.,Search,2003,1412,"Jeffrey H. Dyer, Wujin  Chu",,,10.1287/ORSC.14.1.57.12806,https://doi.org/10.1287/ORSC.14.1.57.12806,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/62cdcc84a59d22af3f045679e9a79cef43fc28d1,,"In this paper we investigate the relationship between supplier trust in the buyer and transaction costs and information sharing in a sample of 344 supplier-automaker exchange relationships in the United States, Japan, and Korea. Our findings indicate that perceived trustworthiness reduces transaction costs and is correlated with greater information sharing in supplier-buyer relationships. Moreover, the findings suggest that the value created for transactors, in terms of lower transaction costs, may be substantial. In particular, we found that the least-trusted automaker spent significantly more of its face-to-face interaction time with suppliers on contracting and haggling when compared to the most trusted automaker. This translated into procurement (transaction) costs that were five times higher for the least trusted automaker. Finally, we argue that trust is unique as a governance mechanism because it not only minimizes transaction costs, but also has a mutually causal relationship with information sharing, which also creates value in the exchange relationship. Other governance mechanisms (e.g., contracts, financial hostages) are necessary costs incurred to prevent opportunistic behavior, but do not create value beyond transaction cost minimization. Our findings provide empirical evidence that trustworthiness lowers transaction costs and may be an important source of competitive advantage.",,
