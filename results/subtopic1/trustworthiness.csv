Trustworthiness,"Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments.",Search,2019,1,Katherine  Hawley,How To Be Trustworthy,,10.1093/oso/9780198843900.003.0004,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198843900.003.0004,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6083a97b5fc6e72b366fb1c2dd0e8349cd301045,,"This chapter explains the account of trustworthiness and untrustworthiness which fits the commitment account of trust and distrust. Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,
Trustworthiness,Trustworthiness is an epistemic desideratum.,Search,2008,130,Catherine Z. Elgin,,,10.1080/05568640809485227,https://doi.org/10.1080/05568640809485227,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a777c01c67d56793abe6406549dbf3f4ac2003c1,,"Abstract I argue that trustworthiness is an epistemic desideratum. It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,

Trustworthiness and Economic Performance,Intrinsically trustworthy agents never cheat.,Search,2010,10,"Janice Boucher Breuer, John  McDermott",,,10.2139/ssrn.1314844,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1314844,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6027e995bf2a790d6e4f917957ff60124fe80146,http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/16777/1/MPRA_paper_16777.pdf,Intrinsically trustworthy agents never cheat. A society's willingness to trust and the quality of its institutions have their origins in the intrinsic trustworthiness of its citizens. Trustworthiness is the basis for maximizing output in economic exchange and in explaining differences in standards of living around the world. We measure intrinsic trustworthiness with a question from the World Values Survey and estimate its effect using a sample of 60 countries. We find that trustworthiness is important for output per capita and that the effect of trust is likely to come from trustworthiness.,,
Trustworthiness and trust: influences and implications,"Trustworthiness impacts both the cognitive and affecting dimensions of trust, with the impact being greatest on cognitive trust.",Search,2014,109,"Harjit  Sekhon, Christine  Ennew, Husni  Kharouf, James F.

Our findings are supported by survey data from customers of UK financial services, with the data points captured over a number of years which allow for fluctuations in trust level. Empirically we find that trustworthiness impacts both the cognitive and affecting dimensions of trust, with the impact being greatest on cognitive trust. As a result of our findings it is possible for practitioner to implement policies to not only build trust but also deal with issues where there is a need to rebuild it, as in the case of our research setting.",,
Trust and Stakeholder Theory: Trustworthiness in the Organisation–Stakeholder Relationship,Organizational trustworthiness may make low-power stakeholders in organizations fairly treated.,Search,2010,196,"Michelle  Greenwood, Harry J. Buren III",,,10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/S10551-010-0414-4,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7efca319d03e872333b9a7d7e0c60c6527b02522,,"Trust is a fundamental aspect of the moral treatment of stakeholders within the organization–stakeholder relationship. Stakeholders trust the organization to return benefit or protections from harm commensurate with their contributions or stakes. However, in many situations, the firm holds greater power than the stakeholder and therefore cannot necessarily be trusted to return the aforementioned duty to the stakeholder. Stakeholders must therefore rely on the trustworthiness of the organization to fulfill obligations in accordance to Phillips’ principle of fairness (Business Ethics Quarterly7(1), 1997, 51–66), particularly where low-power stakeholders may not be fully consenting (Van Buren III, Business Ethics Quarterly11(3), 2001, 481–499). The construct of organizational trustworthiness developed herewith is presented as a possible solution to the problem of unfairness in organization–stakeholder relations. While organizational trustworthiness does not create an ethical obligation where none existed before, stakeholders who lack power will likely be treated fairly when organizational trustworthiness is present.",,
Trustworthiness by Default,An agent's lattice of degrees of trustworthiness can be applied to the problem of forming the right opinion.,Search,2005,8,"Johan W.

Trustworthiness criteria for supporting users to assess the credibility of web information,Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information.,Search,2013,21,"Jarutas  Pattanaphanchai, Kieron  O'Hara, Wendy  Hall",WWW '13 Companion,,10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://doi.org/10.1145/2487788.2488132,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9adf6b120bcb40e317160baed50cbbdb791931af,,"Assessing the quality of information on the Web is a challenging issue for at least two reasons. First, as a decentralized data publishing platform in which anyone can share nearly anything, the Web has no inherent quality control mechanisms to ensure that content published is valid, legitimate, or even just interesting. Second, when assessing the trustworthiness of web pages, users tend to base their judgments upon descriptive criteria such as the visual presentation of the website rather than more robust normative criteria such as the author's reputation and the source's review process. As a result, Web users are liable to make incorrect assessments, particularly when making quick judgments on a large scale. Therefore, Web users need credibility criteria and tools to help them assess the trustworthiness of Web information in order to place trust in it. In this paper, we investigate the criteria that can be used to collect supportive data about a piece of information in order to improve a person's ability to quickly judge the trustworthiness of the information. We propose the normative trustworthiness criteria namely, authority, currency, accuracy and relevance which can be used to support users' assessments of the trustworthiness of Web information. In addition, we validate these criteria using an expert panel. The results show that the proposed criteria are helpful. Moreover, we obtain weighting scores for criteria which can be used to calculate the trustworthiness of information and suggest a piece of information that is more likely to be trustworthy to Web users.",,Review
Trustworthiness,"Leaders who can admit mistakes, acknowledge weakness, applaud strength, and help each other will be capable of building trust.",Search,2002,,Karl  Rihaczek,Datenschutz und Datensicherheit,,10.4018/978-1-7998-8950-2.ch004,https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-7998-8950-2.ch004,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ce12be690c737e7aa12884deadba60f6b613f535,,"We can use trustworthiness and trust interchangeably because they both relate to the importance of LMX. Trustworthiness, then, is the quality of a person, or a thing, that inspires reliability. The existence of trustworthiness is shown through qualities like being respectful, honest, consistent, positive, and selfless. Leaders who can admit mistakes, acknowledge weakness, applaud strength, and help each other, and who can promote those qualities in the workforce, will be capable of building trust. Mutual trust is important, and everyone has a lot at stake with trust issues because of the inherent risks. Those risks are about putting one's faith or a pending decision in the hands of someone in whom you have not yet developed confidence in, or in whom there are limits to that confidence. Leaders who follow telework policies developed in response to COVID-19 must build trust with subordinates and superiors alike. Trust can then grow as emotions are shared, real understanding developed, and core issues are addressed professionally.",,

Trustworthiness as an Impression,"Between solution providers and their clients, the suppliers establish their trustworthiness and their trustworthiness is examined by their potential customers.",Search,2008,4,Dominika  Latusek,,,10.4018/978-1-59904-564-1.CH009,https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59904-564-1.CH009,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e9f82f8a97c99c48423591d571ba982815636027,,"This chapter discusses current developments in the theory of trust and distrust drawing upon a field study between solution providers and their clients in the IT industry in Poland. It addresses the question of how the suppliers (trust-takers) establish the image of being trustworthy, and how their trustworthiness is in turn examined by their potential customers, when cooperation takes place in the context of the openly expressed lack of trust (or distrust). Trust in the chapter is seen as a tranquilizer that suspends the feeling of vulnerability and enables action regardless of uncertainty involved in the situation. Cooperation is understood in dramaturgic terms--the supplier is to produce an impression that will make them appear trustworthy as perceived by the customer.",,
Perceived trustworthiness of knowledge sources: the moderating impact of relationship length.,Relationship length does not directly affect perceived trustworthiness but moderates the association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other.,Search,2006,292,"Daniel Z Levin, Ellen M Whitener, Rob  Cross",The Journal of applied psychology,,10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1163,https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1163,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/aaccdac1dee04a08c94b8297ee0ecb70336ad638,http://www.levin.rutgers.edu/research/trust-bases-paper.pdf,"Prior meta-analytic evidence has indicated no association between relationship length and perceived trustworthiness. Viewing trustors as information processors, the authors propose a model in which relationship length, although having no direct effect on perceived trustworthiness, moderates the association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other. Specifically, as trustors learn about others, they base their trust on different kinds of information (demographic similarity, trustworthy behavior, and shared perspective). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of a field survey of supervisors and subordinates from 3 companies (N = 88) provide evidence consistent with this prediction: Perceived trustworthiness is associated with demographic similarity in newer relationships, with trustworthy behavior in relationships that are neither brand new nor old but in-between, and with shared perspective in older relationships.",,

Trust and Trustworthiness,Trust and trustworthiness support cooperation within and across organizations.,Search,2018,279,"Özalp  Özer, Yanchong  Zheng",The Handbook of Behavioral Operations,,10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f05c70163160b4ec3b1a8cfc2ff0e87e50b943c7,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/120755/1/SSRN-id3046303.pdf,"In this chapter, we discuss when, how, and why trust and trustworthiness arise to support cooperation within and across organizations. To do so, we first define trust and trustworthiness, discuss how they can be quantified and determine key components of trusting and trustworthy behavior. In addition, we identify building blocks of trust and trustworthiness and offer tangible insights about how to establish trusting and cooperative business/inter-organizational relationships, based on both academic research and case studies from across industries. We all know that trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of our relationships, business or otherwise. Our friends, foes, family, colleagues, sociologists, management scientists, and even economists recognize this fact (even though some may not acknowledge it). We innately believe being trustworthy is a virtue (or, at least, are taught to think so) and have learned whether and when to trust (to the best of our abilities). And when we trust, we put ourselves in a vulnerable situation (i.e., we take a risk) based upon the expectation that the person we trusted (trustee) behaves in a positive way that is rewarding to us (as trustors). So, we make a risky “investment” of some sort and face uncertainty in the outcome (and may even regret later) when we trust. We also perhaps adjust our trusting and trustworthy behavior depending on the target of our trust, given the relevant context. For example, we may trust our significant other that he or she will return the $250 (or the car) we lend him or her (perhaps with an implicit or explicit expectation of a positive return beyond the actual loan). We probably would not ask him or her to write a contract before lending our car. However, most of us would perhaps require a marriage certificate (a binding contract that can only be annulled after a legal hearing) accepting all requirements governing a marriage before we commit “to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part...” and ensure that we provide and receive the care and commitment in the presence of conflicting objectives that we will all face during our marriage. Similarly, most successful business and economic relationships are built upon a considerable degree of mutual trust and trustworthiness. As Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow wrote, “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust” (Arrow 1972). Trust has been the glue for most transactions within and across cultures as long as humans have socialized and transacted. Business owners and practitioners are not oblivious to this fact. They do not begin talking with a potential partner by first writing a complete set of contracts stipulating all 1 Note that you neither need a marriage certificate nor need to rely on trust if (the big if) your spouse’s and your objectives are and will be perfectly aligned with absolutely no uncertainty 100% of the time during the span of your life. Similarly, in such a case, there is no need for a preor post-nuptial agreement.",,

Lack of trust within an organization can result in employee disengagement and organizational atrophy. An untrustworthy organization will not only alienate its employees, it will also cause damage to customer interests. In this article, we postulate how trustworthiness can act as a dialectical fulcrum between the diametrically opposing market/social forces within an economic/political organization—such as self-interest versus public good, cooperation versus competition, freedom versus control, labor versus capital, and production versus consumption.",,
Managing images of trustworthiness in organizations,Perceived trustworthiness is an important factor in engendering people's willingness to subject themselves to the actions of others.,Search,2004,49,Kimberly D. Elsbach,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30862b8cd95369f737447b6981eb8c618f99d605,,"Author(s): Elsbach, KD | Abstract: To possess an image of interpersonal trustworthiness is to be perceived by others as displaying (now and in the future) competence, benevolence, and integrity in one's behaviors and beliefs (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman 1995; Mayer and Davis 1999). In this definition, interpersonal trustworthiness is defined as a perception of trustworthiness from and about social interactions. In a corporate context, competence refers to the abilities and skills that allow a manager to have power and influence in the organization, benevolence refers to a manager's desire to do good on behalf of organizational members, and integrity refers to a manager's adherence to principles or ideals that an organization's members find acceptable. This definition is based on recent frameworks which define trust as ""a willingness to be vulnerable to the actions of another party."" (Mayer and Davis 1999, 124). That is, where trust is defined as a willingness or intent to submit to the actions of another, trustworthiness is defined as a perception that a trusted person, a trustee, will exhibit specific behaviors that commonly engender a willingness to submit to that person's actions. These definitions of trust and trustworthiness are supported by recent research that identifies both motivation and ability as bases of trust in organizations (Mishra 1996; Brockner and Siegel 1996), and uses the components of intention and belief to define trust (McKnight, Cummings, and Chervany 1998).1 Such definitions seem particularly appropriate in managerial settings, where trust often means submitting to the direction of leaders with little knowledge about the consequences of those directions. In such risky or ambiguous situations, perceived trustworthiness has been shown to be an important factor in engendering people's willingness to subject themselves to the actions of others (Kramer and Tyler 1996). For example, F. David Schoorman, Roger C. Mayer, and James H. Davis (1996) found that perceived trustworthiness in a staff member contributed significantly to a veterinarian's willingness to delegate to that staff member risky tasks such as administering anesthesia. Similarly, in a fourteenmonth field study of management performance appraisal systems, Mayer and Davis (1999) found that enhancing perceived benevolence, integrity, and competence by means of implementing a new performance appraisal system increased employees ""willingness to let top management have control over"" employee and organizational well-being.

As one main contribution, we present an extensive list of software quality attributes that contribute to trustworthiness. Those software quality attributes have been identified by a systematic review of the research literature and by analyzing two real-world use cases.

This approach combines the attitude of one actor with the characteristics of another actor. Many analyses stress the importance of being trustful. In the idealistic tradition, faith and social education nurturing positive expectations are the keys to trust and cooperation. However, the present analysis finds trustworthiness to be the crucial factor. Overoptimistic or deceitful promises will fool and disappoint the trustful actor, making him distrustful, while experience of trustworthy partners will enhance further cooperation. Hence, the degree of trustworthiness is the central factor for whether trust increases or decreases.",,
The modular nature of trustworthiness detection.,People of higher intelligence are better able to detect signs of untrustworthiness from potential partners.,Search,2013,84,"Jean-François  Bonnefon, Astrid  Hopfensitz, Wim  De Neys",Journal of experimental psychology.

Trustworthiness detection from faces is independent of general intelligence (Study 1) and effortless (Study 2). Pictures that include nonfacial features such as hair and clothing impair trustworthiness detection (Study 3) by increasing reliance on conscious judgments (Study 4), but people largely prefer to make decisions from this sort of pictures (Study 5). In sum, trustworthiness detection in an economic interaction is a genuine and effortless ability, possessed in equal amount by people of all cognitive capacities, but whose impenetrability leads to inaccurate conscious judgments and inappropriate informational preferences.",,

Our results indicate that -- besides unconditional other-regarding preferences -- vulnerability-responsiveness is an important determinant of trustworthiness even in cases where the vulnerability of the trustor does not come together with a gift to the trustee. Motivated by our empirical findings we provide formal definitions of trust and trustworthiness based on revealed willingness to accept vulnerability and the response to it.",,
