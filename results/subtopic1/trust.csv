In this study trust was defined as an expectancy held by an individual that the behavior of another person or a group would be altruistic and personally beneficial. An attempt was made, using this conceptual definition, to identify some personality and behavioral correlates of trust. Seven interpersonal relations groups with approximately 10 male and female undergraduates per group were studied with use of the Janis and Field self-esteem inventory, Schutz's FIRO-B scale, and the Rotter internal-external scale. It was discovered that a trusted person is one who is highly influential, has an internal locus of control, a low need to control others, high self-esteem, and is open to being influenced by others.",,

Trust is a moral value that does not depend upon personal experience or on interacting with people in civic groups or informal socializing. Instead, we learn to trust from our parents, and trust is stable over long periods of time. Trust depends on an optimistic world view: the world is a good place and we can make it better. Trusting people are more likely to give through charity and volunteering. Trusting societies are more likely to redistribute resources from the rich to the poor. Trust has been in decline in the United States for over 30 years. The roots of this decline are traceable to declining optimism and increasing economic inequality, which Uslaner supports by aggregate time series in the United States and cross-sectional data across market economies.",,

The reality and importance of this situation is evidently clear when considering trust in the life of a person, society, or the world, even if this story is fictional. Now, imagine you were airborne in a commercial airliner, negotiating altitude at the eye of a heavy storm. And, image your life depended on the knowledge and ability of the plane’s captain, who had suffered a mild stroke and was unable to perform optimally. The co-captain, with less experience, immediately took over control of the faltering plane although with less predictable results. When considering this possibility, trust, again, represents the essence of continuing survival. Imagine once more that your welfare relied on the dedication and participation of poorly prepared health professionals and that you were not sure you were receiving the best health care. Imagine you could not accept their care if your life depended on it. Your future, suddenly and dramatically, becomes threatened and purposeless. Trust is missing! The previous examples reflect very clearly the far-reaching dimensions and overwhelming, encompassing effects of trust. Trust means to believe in the integrity and reliance of another. According to Webster’s Dictionary, trust is “to have confidence in; to expect with assurance; to believe in someone in whom confidence is placed” [1]. Confidence, at the same time, is to have “certainty in the trustworthiness of another” [1]. Trust and confidence come from the same tree and represent the same family. They are basically the same word with a different wrapping. Confidence is “the assurance that someone will keep a secret” [1, 2]. How is it then that surgeons utilize trust in the evolving and changing relationships of their profession? How is it that surgeons cannot proceed further without the enduring presence of trust? How is it that surgeons cannot practice their art or science under trustless circumstances? The response is so evidently clear that an explanation appears to be hardly required and mostly redundant.

Trust: nature and dynamics,"Trust is a multi-role relation between an agent and another agent, a process or a technology.",Search,2011,6,Cristiano  Castelfranchi,CHItaly,,10.1145/2037296.2037302,https://doi.org/10.1145/2037296.2037302,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3145cddfb0aefed58c65e385a4cc12bb6a178e39,,"Trust is a complex notion -- with various components and dimensions-, and a multi-role relation: Trust (x y t G c); x trusts y as for action/task t useful for goal G, in context c.

It is an attitude, a disposition towards another agent (natural, technical, or social) on which our ""welfare"", that is, the realization of some goal of us, depends. This attitude makes us disposed to expose ourselves to failure or damage by relying on y for satisfying our goal.

This attitude towards y can be based just on feelings of safety and perceived benevolence, or on feelings due to the analogical evocation of previous or similar positive experiences; or it is more ""rational"", or better ""reason-based"", grounded on some specific beliefs, evaluations, and expectations about y, that justify our reliance. On the basis of this positive expectation and evaluation we decide to depend on y.

Thus, trust also is a decision and an act: the act of trusting y as for t, of exposing ourselves to dependence. And it also becomes a specific relation between x and y. Trust in y (on the basis of the strength of our beliefs or feelings) can be sufficient or insufficient for our decision to delegate; depending on the perceived risk and possible harm.

The evaluation of y, on which the expectation is based, has two basic components: (i) y's ""competence"", efficacy, expertise: ""Is y really able and in condition to perform the expected 'action' and produce the desired outcome?"" (ii) y's ""willingness"": ""Will y actually perform the needed action?"", ""Is y predictable, reliable?"", ""Is y really willing to do the expected action?"". Clearly these two kinds of evaluation are rather independent: y can be very well disposed but not really skilled; or y can be really able but not credible.

Moreover, trust as judgment implies the 'internal attribution' to y of skills, qualities, 'virtues'; but it also imply some evaluation about the 'external' favorable or adverse contextual conditions for y's action. This is why not necessarily y's failure entails a decreasing of y's trustworthiness; it might not be his fault, but just due to 'external' interferences.

Trust in not only 'social', addressed towards other persons; it can be also towards some process or mechanism (I can trust or not a given elevator), and technology: how much effective and good is it as for its service; how much reliable and predictable; how much accessible and friendly;...? The opposite (but complementary) side of trust is the perceived risk and the perceived unreliability or unmanageability of the technology.

Trust dynamics is a very important and complex issue, with many aspects.

On the one side, there is the problem of trust transitivity: if x trust y, and y trust z, will x trust z? Not automatically: it depends on the specific object of those trust relations. If x trust y ""as good evaluator of t performances"" and y trust z as for t, then x will trust z as for t.

On the other side, there is the general problem of trust transfer:

(a) If x trust y as for t, will x trust y also for another task t'? It depends: do the qualities, skills, needed for successfully performing t overlapping with the quality needed for t'? If ""Yes"", the trustworthiness of y as for t is a good predictor of y's trustworthiness also for t'.

(b) If x trusts y as for t, will x trust z for t? It depends on the similarity between y and z: does z have the same qualities of y necessary for t?

Another important dynamics is trust as self-fulfilling prophecy. Trust is an expectation, but this expectation can affect the expected outcome, both its probability and quality. In fact, on the one side x's positive evaluation of y can increase y's commitment, effort, self-esteem, etc. and influence the quality of y's performance. On the other side, the fact that x is or becomes dependent on y can increase y's 'benevolence' or responsibility towards x. In general, it is well known that trust can induce trust and reciprocation, while diffidence elicits diffidence.

Finally, those dynamics can be taken into account even in x's evaluation and decision to trust: perhaps x's trust in y would not be sufficient, but x predicts that his act of trusting y will increase y's reliability and performance, thus trust becomes enough and x decides to trust/rely on y.

Trust technology. Trust is a very dialectic and dynamic phenomenon, and it should acquire the same level of quality with technology. There are two different (but not independent) perspectives on that:

(i) A technology really able to support social trust relations and to create new trust dimensions among humans.

(ii) A trustworthy technology deserving and eliciting trust disposition, which is not at all just a matter of ""security"", like engineers currently believes.",,
Trust: towards conceptual clarification,Trust is universally regarded as a ‘good thing’ at both the interpersonal level and as a means of bringing stability to social institutions and markets.,Search,2004,51,Bob  Hudson,,,10.1080/1036114042000205650,https://doi.org/10.1080/1036114042000205650,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/50ecd1577e66a5712cbbb91e8c0208cf8a399489,,"Trust is universally regarded as a ‘good thing’ at both the interpersonal level and as a means of bringing stability to social institutions and markets.

It allows us to reveal vulnerable parts of ourselves to others and to know others intimately in return. A climate of trust eases cooperation among people and fosters reciprocal caretaking. The resources—physical, emotional, economic—that would otherwise be consumed guarding against harm can be directed toward more constructive ends. Here, we explore the nature of trust and how and where it flourishes online. We also seek to make sense of seemingly disparate perceptions. For example, some say the public is too trusting online; without thinking, people routinely download software likely to destroy important information or blithely engage in e-auctions or chat rooms with strangers. Others say the public does not trust enough, that people refrain, for example, from e-commerce under the mistaken belief that their financial transactions are not secure. How can we know if the trust we choose to give or withhold is warranted? Can we trust machines or other technological systems? How can those of us who create and maintain the technological infrastructure help establish a climate of trust? Addressing such questions, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding trust, then offer 10 characteristics of online interaction that can help engineer trust online and distinguish between trust in e-commerce activities and trust in online interpersonal interactions.",,
Trust and Trustworthiness,"Trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of our relationships, business or otherwise.",Search,2018,279,"Özalp  Özer, Yanchong  Zheng",The Handbook of Behavioral Operations,,10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119138341.CH14,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f05c70163160b4ec3b1a8cfc2ff0e87e50b943c7,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/120755/1/SSRN-id3046303.pdf,"In this chapter, we discuss when, how, and why trust and trustworthiness arise to support cooperation within and across organizations. To do so, we first define trust and trustworthiness, discuss how they can be quantified and determine key components of trusting and trustworthy behavior. In addition, we identify building blocks of trust and trustworthiness and offer tangible insights about how to establish trusting and cooperative business/inter-organizational relationships, based on both academic research and case studies from across industries. We all know that trust and trustworthiness matter in almost all aspects of our relationships, business or otherwise. Our friends, foes, family, colleagues, sociologists, management scientists, and even economists recognize this fact (even though some may not acknowledge it). We innately believe being trustworthy is a virtue (or, at least, are taught to think so) and have learned whether and when to trust (to the best of our abilities). And when we trust, we put ourselves in a vulnerable situation (i.e., we take a risk) based upon the expectation that the person we trusted (trustee) behaves in a positive way that is rewarding to us (as trustors). So, we make a risky “investment” of some sort and face uncertainty in the outcome (and may even regret later) when we trust. We also perhaps adjust our trusting and trustworthy behavior depending on the target of our trust, given the relevant context. For example, we may trust our significant other that he or she will return the $250 (or the car) we lend him or her (perhaps with an implicit or explicit expectation of a positive return beyond the actual loan). We probably would not ask him or her to write a contract before lending our car. However, most of us would perhaps require a marriage certificate (a binding contract that can only be annulled after a legal hearing) accepting all requirements governing a marriage before we commit “to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part...” and ensure that we provide and receive the care and commitment in the presence of conflicting objectives that we will all face during our marriage. Similarly, most successful business and economic relationships are built upon a considerable degree of mutual trust and trustworthiness. As Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow wrote, “Virtually every commercial transaction has within itself an element of trust” (Arrow 1972). Trust has been the glue for most transactions within and across cultures as long as humans have socialized and transacted. Business owners and practitioners are not oblivious to this fact. They do not begin talking with a potential partner by first writing a complete set of contracts stipulating all 1 Note that you neither need a marriage certificate nor need to rely on trust if (the big if) your spouse’s and your objectives are and will be perfectly aligned with absolutely no uncertainty 100% of the time during the span of your life. Similarly, in such a case, there is no need for a preor post-nuptial agreement.",,
Trust and Distrust In Organizations: Dilemmas and Approaches,Trust is a desirable but fragile resource within organizational boundaries.,Search,2004,168,"Roderick M. Kramer, Karen S. Cook",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/08dba9ce34cec731758337acd434bf86d392705a,,"FOR MORE than a decade now, the topic of trust has been at the center of scholarly research on organizations. The ascension of trust as a major focus of research in the organizational sciences reflects in no small measure a large body of evidence documenting the substantial and varied benefits that accrue when trust is in place within organizational boundaries. Coupled with this strong evidence of the benefits of trust is an acute appreciation of the problematic nature of organizational trust. Although trust may be a desirable resource, it is often a fragile and elusive one. Interest in trust as an important dimension of organizational functioning was initially stimulated by a number of influential works on social trust, including most notably Robert Putnam’s (1993) provocative findings implicating trust as a critical factor in explaining the origins of civic engagement and the development of democratic regimes in Italian communities. Putnam’s argument attracted wide attention and was followed up by Francis Fukuyama’s (1995) comparative survey of evidence that trust plays a critical role in societal functioning. In the years following these initial landmark volumes, a number of additional works (for example, Cook 2001; Hardin 2002; Putnam 2000; Sztompka 1999) have added to the stock of studies of trust in the social sciences. Viewed in the aggregate, these contributions converge on the conclusion that trust often constitutes an important resource within social systems.",,
Designing trust into online experiences,Trust is an essential component of online experiences that must be designed into them to facilitate cooperative behavior.,Search,2000,464,Ben  Shneiderman,CACM,,10.1145/355112.355124,https://doi.org/10.1145/355112.355124,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d75b20805b243a3f0082bde19e4d4d24744d105,,"A ncient social traditions were designed to elicit trust during uncertain encounters. Handshaking demonstrated the absence of weapons. Clinking of glasses evolved from pouring wine back and forth to prove it was not poisoned. Now, new social traditions are needed to enhance cooperative behaviors in electronic environments supporting e-commerce, e-services, and online communities. Since users of online systems can’t savor a cup of tea with an electronic rug merchant, designers must develop strategies for facilitating e-commerce and auctions. Since users can’t make eye contact and judge intonations with an online lawyer or physician, designers must create new social norms for professional services. Since users can’t stroll through online communities encountering neighbors with their children, designers must facilitate the trust that enables collective action. In parallel, consumer groups must be vigorous in monitoring and reporting deceptions and disreputable business practices. Political scientist Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland calls trust “the chicken soup of the social sciences. It brings us all sorts of good things—from a willingness to get involved in our communities to higher rates of economic growth ... to making daily life more pleasant. Yet, like chicken soup, it appears to work somewhat mysteriously” [5]. He tries to sort out the mystery by distinguishing between moral trust, or the durable optimistic view that strangers are well-intentioned, and strategic trust, or the willingness of two people to participate in a specific exchange (see Uslaner’s “Social Capital and the Net” in this section). Trust facilitates cooperative behavior. It is a complex term that has generated dozens of doctoral dissertations, not only in sociology and political science, but now in information systems research as well. There are enough dimensions to trust and its failures to keep scholars and philosophers busy for some time, but e-commerce, e-services, and online community designers need a guide to practical action [4]. The designer’s goal is to engage users quickly and establish and preserve strategic trust under challenging situations. But for many users, strategic trust is difficult to generate, shaken easily, and once shaken extremely difficult to rebuild. Strategic trust is fragile. The extensive literature on trust offers multiple perspectives. In his politically oriented book Trust, Francis Fukuyama, a former U.S. State Department analyst, claims: “Trust is the expectation that arises within a community of regular, honest, and cooperative behavior, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of the members of that community” [2]. This compact definition embodies several key con-",,

Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,

We measure trust and trustworthiness in British society with a newly designed experiment using real monetary rewards and a sample of the British population. The study also asks the typical survey question that aims to measure trust, showing that it does not predict ‘trust’ as measured in the experiment. Overall, about 40% of people were willing to trust a stranger in our experiment, and their trust was rewarded half of the time. Analysis of variation in the trust behaviour in our survey suggests that trusting is more likely if people are older, their financial situation is either ‘comfortable’ or ‘difficult’ compared with ‘doing alright’ or ‘just getting by’, they are a homeowner or they are divorced, separated or never married compared with those who are married or cohabiting. Trustworthiness also is more likely among subjects who are divorced or separated relative to those who are married or cohabiting, and less likely among subjects who perceive their financial situation as ‘just getting by’ or ‘difficult’.

Mutual trust is important, and everyone has a lot at stake with trust issues because of the inherent risks. Those risks are about putting one's faith or a pending decision in the hands of someone in whom you have not yet developed confidence in, or in whom there are limits to that confidence. Leaders who follow telework policies developed in response to COVID-19 must build trust with subordinates and superiors alike. Trust can then grow as emotions are shared, real understanding developed, and core issues are addressed professionally.",,
Trust as dependence: a logical approach,Trust applies to a variety of attributes of the relationship between truster and trustee.,Search,2011,48,Munindar P. Singh,AAMAS,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a0d727c521d19aea5d4d2a2e2ffb1eff42c8a777,,"We propose that the trust an agent places in another agent declaratively captures an architectural connector between the two agents. We formulate trust as a generic modality expressing a relationship between a truster and a trustee. Specifically, trust here is definitionally independent of, albeit constrained by, other relevant modalities such as commitments and beliefs. Trust applies to a variety of attributes of the relationship between truster and trustee. For example, an agent may trust someone to possess an important capability, exercise good judgment, or to intend to help it. Although such varieties of trust are hugely different, they respect common logical patterns. We present a logic of trust that expresses such patterns as reasoning postulates concerning the static representation of trust, its dynamics, and its relationships with teamwork and other agent interactions. In this manner, the proposed logic illustrates the general properties of trust that reflect natural intuitions, and can facilitate the engineering of multiagent systems.",,
A survey of trust in computer science and the Semantic Web,Trust is an essential component of the vision for the Semantic Web.,Search,2007,756,"Donovan  Artz, Yolanda  Gil",J.

For example, exchanging money for a service, giving access to your property, and choosing between conflicting sources of information all may utilize some form of trust. In computer science, trust is a widely used term whose definition differs among researchers and application areas. Trust is an essential component of the vision for the Semantic Web, where both new problems and new applications of trust are being studied. This paper gives an overview of existing trust research in computer science and the Semantic Web.",,Review
Understanding trust and confidence: two paradigms and their significance for health and social care.,UK Government 'modernisation' policy in health and social care privileges confidence in systems over trust in moral agents.,Search,2005,76,Carole  Smith,Journal of applied philosophy,,10.1111/J.1468-5930.2005.00312.X,https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1468-5930.2005.00312.X,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3690bcb76e0be8df1aafd2b13267d5777f6e277a,,"Trusting agents characteristically anticipate beneficial outcomes, under conditions of uncertainty, in their engagement with others. However, debates about trust incorporate different interpretations of risk, uncertainty, calculation, affect, morality and motivation in explaining when trust is appropriate and how it operates. This article argues that discussions about trust have produced a concept without coherent boundaries and with little operational value. Two paradigms are identified, which distinguish the characteristics of trust and confidence. It is argued that a reliance on confidence in human affairs makes trust redundant and that this has undesirable moral consequences. Discussion is illustrated by the UK Government's 'modernisation' policy in health and social care, which privileges confidence in systems over trust in moral agents.",,
Trustworthiness*,B is trustworthy with A if she is competent with the domain and would take the fact that A is counting on her.,Search,2012,39,Karen  Jones,Ethics,,10.1086/667838,https://doi.org/10.1086/667838,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b6351a82a769a94b73cdf7e1d86bd37d84536943,,"I present and defend an account of three-place trustworthiness according to which B is trustworthy with respect to A in domain of interaction D, if and only if she is competent with respect to that domain, and she would take the fact that A is counting on her, were A to do so in this domain, to be a compelling reason for acting as counted on. This is not the whole story of trustworthiness, however, for we want those we can count on to identify themselves so that we can place our trust wisely.",,
Trust and expected trustworthiness: an experimental investigation,Trust is higher where greater trustworthiness is expected and lower variance in levels of trustworthiness is perceived.,Search,2001,15,Abigail  Barr,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd1234f0119ed17a1e4516759488662a76cff2b7,,"An economic experiment involving separate sessions in 24 small, tightly knit communities reveals that trust is higher where greater trustworthiness is expected and lower variance in levels of trustworthiness is perceived. A model in which potential trusters behaviour is likened to a risky investment explains nearly fifty percent of the variation in their behaviour between communities. The predicted relationships continue to exist following the introduction of an additional, important variable relating to resettlement into the model, although the precise forms of the relationships vary between different types of community. The 24 communities are all Zimbabwean, 18 resettled and 6 not.",,
"Trustworthiness is a social norm, but trusting is not",People behave as though being trustworthy is a norm.,Search,2011,90,"Cristina  Bicchieri, Erte  Xiao, Ryan  Muldoon",,,10.1177/1470594X10387260,https://doi.org/10.1177/1470594X10387260,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/70909d22d1107be9f491db85a4f1225573d6cb41,,"Previous literature has demonstrated the important role that trust plays in developing and maintaining well-functioning societies. However, if we are to learn how to increase levels of trust in society, we must first understand why people choose to trust others. One potential answer to this is that people view trust as normative: there is a social norm for trusting that imposes punishment for noncompliance. To test this, we report data from a survey with salient rewards to elicit people’s attitudes regarding the punishment of distrusting behavior in a trust game. Our results show that people do not behave as though trust is a norm. Our participants expected that most people would not punish untrusting investors, regardless of whether the potential trustee was a stranger or a friend. In contrast, our participants behaved as though being trustworthy is a norm. Most participants believed that most people would punish someone who failed to reciprocate a stranger’s or a friend’s trust. We conclude that, while we were able to reproduce previous results establishing that there is a norm of reciprocity, we found no evidence for a corresponding norm of trust, even among friends.",,
Trust and suspicion,"The word ""trust"" does not appear in any of the social psychology textbooks' indexes.",Search,1958,1979,Morton  Deutsch,,,10.1177/002200275800200401,https://doi.org/10.1177/002200275800200401,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/701590a5ae1fab9116d3972353e0792d601359b5,,"Whenever philosophers, poets, statesmen, or theologians have written about man's relationship to his fellow man, to nature, or to animals, the phenomena of trust and betrayal, faith and suspicion, responsibility and irresponsibility, have been discussed. The significance of the phenomena of trust and suspicion in human life is attested to not only by past preoccupations but also by current concerns. Discussion of such problems as the armaments race, mental illness, the ""hidden persuaders,"" and juvenile delinquency frequently employ such terms as ""trust,"" ""suspicion,"" ""betrayal,"" ""faith."" Past preoccupations and current concerns make it apparent that the concept of ""trust"" and its related concepts are vital to the understanding both of social life and of personality development. Yet an examination of a half-dozen or more of the leading textbooks in social psychology (e.g., texts by Cartwright and Zander, Homans, Krech and Crutchfield, Lewin, Lindsey, Newcomb) reveals that the word ""trust"" does not appear in any of their indexes. So far as we know, the research summarized in this paper represents the first attempt to investigate experimentally the phenomena of trust.",,
