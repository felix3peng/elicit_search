Drivers’ trust in an autonomous system,Body movements are not sensitive to individual differences in reported trust.,Search,2016,5,"Timothy J. Wright, William J. Horrey, Mary F. Lesch, Mahmudur  Rahman",,,10.1177/1541931213601308,https://doi.org/10.1177/1541931213601308,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f15b7a99a951c67e35a3725bb2bc0916982852c3,,"Drivers’ trust in automation will likely determine the extent that autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles are adopted, and once adopted, used properly. Unfortunately, previous studies have typically utilized overt subjective measures in determining an individual’s level of trust in automation. The current study aims to evaluate a covert behavioral measure of trust based on drivers’ body (head, hand, and foot) movements as they experience a simulated autonomous system. Videos of drivers interacting with an autonomous driving system in a driving simulator were coded. Body movement counts and average durations were derived from this coding and these data were compared across quartile rankings (based on self-reported trust) to examine body movements’ sensitivity to drivers’ level of trust. Results suggest body movements are not sensitive to individual differences in reported trust. Future work should further examine the utility of this covert behavioral metric by further examining situational differences.",,
Trust in vehicle technology,Driver trust has potentially important implications for how vehicle technology is used and interacted with.,Search,2016,43,"Guy H. Walker, Neville A. Stanton, Paul M.

In this paper, it will be seen how driver trust functions and how it can be understood and manipulated by insightful vehicle design. It will review the theoretical literature to define steps that can be taken to establish trust in vehicle technology in the first place, maintain trust in the long term, and even re-establish trust that has been lost along the way. The paper presents a synthesis of the wider trust literature, integrates key trust parameters, describes practically how to measure trust, and presents a set of principles for vehicle designers to use in assessing existing design decisions and justify new ones.",,Review
An investigation into sharing economy enabled ridesharing drivers' trust: A qualitative study,"The key factors influencing trust-in-passenger are driving expenses, social interactions, enjoyment, cancelling the order, paying on time, politeness, appearance, rating and online reviews.",Search,2020,16,"Xusen  Cheng, Linlin  Su, Bo  Yang",Electron.

There is a lack of drivers sharing cars due to a trust issue in ridesharing. In order to understand the drivers’ trust and sharing intention in ridesharing, this study used a qualitative research method regarding uncertainty reduction theory (URT) as the main theoretical framework. By conducting and analysing interviews with the ridesharing drivers in China, this paper demonstrates that the key factors influencing trust-in-passenger are driving expenses, social interactions, enjoyment, cancelling the order, paying on time, politeness, appearance, rating and online reviews. We have also proposed a trust traffic-light model (TLM) of ridesharing as well as a ridesharing drivers’ trust (RDT) onion model to understand the importance of each factor and to exhibit them all. Meanwhile, trust-in-passenger influences the drivers’ sharing intention. This paper contributes to the field of ridesharing and trust.",,Review
"Trusting a Virtual Driver That Looks, Acts, and Thinks Like You",Similarity between a human driver and a virtual driver in a self-driving car could increase the trust in the virtual driver.,Search,2015,46,"Frank M.

Background: Trust is an important psychological factor determining the acceptance of smart systems. Because smart systems tend to be treated like humans, and similarity has been shown to increase trust in humans, we expected that similarity would increase trust in a virtual agent. Methods: In a driving simulator experiment, participants (N = 111) were presented with a virtual agent that was either similar to them or not. This agent functioned as their virtual driver in a driving simulator, and trust in this agent was measured. Furthermore, we measured how trust changed with experience. Results: Prior to experiencing the agent, the similar agent was trusted more than the dissimilar agent. This effect was mediated by perceived similarity. After experiencing the agent, the similar agent was still trusted more than the dissimilar agent. Conclusion: Just as similarity between humans increases trust in another human, similarity also increases trust in a virtual agent. When such an agent is presented as a virtual driver in a self-driving car, it could possibly enhance the trust people have in such a car. Application: Displaying a virtual driver that is similar to the human driver might increase trust in a self-driving car.",,

Will passengers trust driverless vehicles?

As such, the role of someone onboard the vehicle will change from the active role of a driver to the passive role of a passenger. The goal of this work is to provide an initial assessment of this interaction, with a specific focus on the impact of different available control interfaces on trust, usability, and performance. Participants interacted with two simulated driverless passenger vehicles that were designed to mirror a real-world prototype vehicle for Soldier transit on a U.S. military installation. Vehicle 1 had a traditional wheel and pedal control interface, as well as two buttons to disengage or re-engage the vehicle's automation system. Vehicle 2 only had the button system available with which to disengage the automation and bring the vehicle to a safe stop in the simulation and then re-engage. Both vehicles were designed to function optimally throughout the virtual environment. Findings suggested equal trust and usability ratings between the two vehicles. However, participants tended to intervene more often with the traditional control interface. Individual differences and preference ratings are reported.",,
Real-Time Estimation of Drivers' Trust in Automated Driving Systems,Trust miscalibration issues hinder the interaction between drivers and self-driving vehicles.,Search,2021,15,"Hebert  Azevedo-Sa, Suresh Kumaar Jayaraman, Connor T.

A modern challenge for automotive engineers is to avoid these trust miscalibration issues through the development of techniques for measuring drivers’ trust in the automated driving system during real-time applications execution. One possible approach for measuring trust is through modeling its dynamics and subsequently applying classical state estimation methods. This paper proposes a framework for modeling the dynamics of drivers’ trust in automated driving systems and also for estimating these varying trust levels. The estimation method integrates sensed behaviors (from the driver) through a Kalman filter-based approach. The sensed behaviors include eye-tracking signals, the usage time of the system, and drivers’ performance on a non-driving-related task. We conducted a study ($$n=80$$n=80) with a simulated SAE level 3 automated driving system, and analyzed the factors that impacted drivers’ trust in the system. Data from the user study were also used for the identification of the trust model parameters. Results show that the proposed approach was successful in computing trust estimates over successive interactions between the driver and the automated driving system. These results encourage the use of strategies for modeling and estimating trust in automated driving systems. Such trust measurement technique paves a path for the design of trust-aware automated driving systems capable of changing their behaviors to control drivers’ trust levels to mitigate both undertrust and overtrust.",,

Results demonstrated inappropriate levels of self-reported trust in relation to the corresponding level of reliability. In addition the DCMs were consolidated over a short period of time, but they did not match that of designers' model of ACC, thus better design solutions may be warranted.",,
Supporting Trust in Autonomous Driving,A driver interface that visualizes the car’s interpretation of the current situation and its corresponding actions can increase trust in autonomous driving.,Search,2017,42,"Renate  Haeuslschmid, Max von Buelow, Bastian  Pfleging, Andreas  Butz",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5ded2cf1ed785dcdd392274075b78dfdf77fa4e0,,"Autonomous cars will likely hit the market soon, but trust into such a technology is one of the big discussion points in the public debate. Drivers who have always been in complete control of their car are expected to willingly hand over control and blindly trust a technology that could kill them. We argue that trust in autonomous driving can be increased by means of a driver interface that visualizes the car’s interpretation of the current situation and its corresponding actions. To verify this, we compared different visualizations in a user study, overlaid to a driving scene: (1) a chauffeur avatar, (2) a world in miniature, and (3) a display of the car’s indicators as the baseline. The world in miniature visualization increased trust the most. The human-like chauffeur avatar can also increase trust, however, we did not find a significant difference between the chauffeur and the baseline. ACM Classification",,

Presenting system uncertainty in automotive UIs for supporting trust calibration in autonomous driving,Drivers provided with the uncertainty information trusted the automated system less than those who did not receive such information.,Search,2013,182,"Tove  Helldin, Göran  Falkman, Maria  Riveiro, Staffan  Davidsson",AutomotiveUI,,10.1145/2516540.2516554,https://doi.org/10.1145/2516540.2516554,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7d88ddeddc8a8c8e71ade8ec4bcdb3dfdd8d0526,,"To investigate the impact of visualizing car uncertainty on drivers' trust during an automated driving scenario, a simulator study was conducted. A between-group design experiment with 59 Swedish drivers was carried out where a continuous representation of the uncertainty of the car's ability to autonomously drive during snow conditions was displayed to one of the groups, whereas omitted for the control group. The results show that, on average, the group of drivers who were provided with the uncertainty representation took control of the car faster when needed, while they were, at the same time, the ones who spent more time looking at other things than on the road ahead. Thus, drivers provided with the uncertainty information could, to a higher degree, perform tasks other than driving without compromising with driving safety. The analysis of trust shows that the participants who were provided with the uncertainty information trusted the automated system less than those who did not receive such information, which indicates a more proper trust calibration than in the control group.",,RCT
Characterizing Driver Trust in Vehicle Control Algorithm Parameters,"The steering wheel deadband, or lateral movement of the vehicle while maintaining lane position, was negatively associated with trust.",Search,2018,2,"Joshua  Domeyer, Vindhya  Venkatraman, Morgan  Price, John D Lee",Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting,,10.1177/1541931218621413,https://doi.org/10.1177/1541931218621413,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/90d7e8959e76f78bc7ea879b840d9ef38f964e37,,"Human factors research in vehicle automation has focused on user interfaces such as performance feedback through visual and auditory displays (Blanco et al., 2015). Another approach is to use vehicle dynamics and vibrations as communicative tools for guiding attention (e.g., Morando, Victor, & Dozza, 2016; Walker, Stanton, & Young, 2006; Wiese & Lee, 2007). In our previous study (Price, Venkatraman, Gibson, Lee, & Mutlu, 2016), we showed that the steering wheel deadband, or lateral movement of the vehicle while maintaining lane position, was negatively associated with trust—more lateral movement led to less trust in the algorithm. The present study extends these findings by using Bayesian statistical methods with new control algorithm data. Although the inclusion of additional algorithm characteristics did not improve the trust model, the use of Bayesian statistical methods provides a useful tool to incorporate prior knowledge into an analysis.",,
Knowledge of and trust in advanced driver assistance systems.,Drivers who are more biased towards endorsing system capabilities have higher trust in ADAS.,Search,2021,3,"Chelsea A.

We surveyed ADAS owners (N = 102) and non-owners (N = 262), with the primary objective of assessing knowledge and trust of ACC and LKA, and investigating the relationship between knowledge and trust among drivers who have not received special training. The survey contained demographic questions, ACC and LKA knowledge questionnaires (assessing knowledge of capabilities and limitations commonly found in owner's manuals), and ACC and LKA trust ratings. From the knowledge questionnaires, sensitivity (i.e., knowledge of the true capabilities of ACC and LKA) and response bias were assessed and used to predict trust. Results showed that owners did not have better knowledge of system capabilities/limitations than non-owners, in fact, owners had a stronger bias in favour of system capabilities. For non-owners, better knowledge of system capabilities was associated with lower trust, and those who were more biased towards endorsing system capabilities had higher trust. Neither knowledge nor response bias was associated with trust among owners. Further research is needed to confirm our results with a larger sample of owners, but given that it is also impractical to expect drivers to learn and remember all possible ADAS limitations, it may be beneficial to focus training efforts on improving drivers' overall understanding of the fallibility of ADAS and reinforcing their role when using ADAS to support appropriate trust and reliance.",,

Vehicles with partially automated driving capabilities are already in the market. Before the widespread adoption however, human factors issues regarding automated driving need to be addressed. One of the key issues is how much drivers trust in automated driving systems and how they calibrate their trust and reliance based on their experience. In this paper, we report the results of a survey conducted with Tesla drivers about their experiences with two advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot and Summon. We found that drivers have high levels of trust in Autopilot and Summon. Trust decreased with age for Autopilot but not for Summon. Drivers who experienced unexpected behaviors from their vehicles reported lower levels of trust in Autopilot. Over time, trust in these systems increased regardless of experience. Additionally, trust was correlated with several attitudinal and behavioral factors such as frequency of use, self-rated knowledge about these systems, and ease of learning. These findings highlight the importance of trust in real world use of autonomous cars. Also, the results suggest that previous findings on trust in automation are applicable to real world cases as well.",,

The human factor challenges of designing safe automated driving systems are critical as the first several generations of automated vehicles are expected to be semi-autonomous, requiring frequent transfers of control between the driver and vehicle. Conditional automation raises particular concerns about drivers being out of the loop. A driving simulator study was performed with 20 participants to study driving with conditional automation. We observed driver performance and measured comfort as an indicator of the development of trust in the system. One scenario used a more capable automation system that was able to respond to most events by slowing or changing lanes on its own. The other scenario used a less capable automation system that issued takeover requests for all events. Participants drove both scenarios in counterbalanced order and experienced the different capabilities as changes in reliability. The automation would behave one way in the first work zone and a different way in the second. We observed three types of comfort profiles over the course of the drives. Several behavioral measures, notably gaze, showed effects of reliability variations. Trust calibrated during the first-driven scenario was seen to affect behavior during the second one, and this effect was more pronounced in the older age group, and most pronounced for women in that group.",,RCT
