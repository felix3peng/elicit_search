Although it will always be possible to lie with a photograph (using such time-honored techniques as false perspective and misleading captions), this proposed device will prevent the explosion of very capable personal computers from driving up the incidence of doctored photographs being passed off as truth. A solution to this problem comes from the proposed digital signature standard (DSS), which incorporates modern cryptographic techniques to authenticate electronic mail messages. >",,
A formal approach for the specification and verification of trustworthy component-based systems,A formal approach for the development of trustworthy component-based systems involves a model transformation technique and a unified formal verification method.,Search,2011,38,"Mubarak  Mohammad, Vangalur S.

Embedded software systems, especially those used in smart devices, have become an essential constituent of the technological infrastructure of modern societies. Such systems, in order to be trusted in society, must be proved to be trustworthy. Trustworthiness is a composite non-functional property that implies safety, timeliness, security, availability, and reliability. This paper presents a formal approach for the development of trustworthy component-based systems. The approach involves a formal component model for the specification of component's structure, functional, and non-functional (trustworthiness) properties, a model transformation technique for the automatic generation of component behavior using the specified structure and restricted by the specified properties, and a unified formal verification method for safety, security, reliability and availability properties using model checking.",,
Trustworthy groups and organisations,Trustworthiness is appreciated for its own sake.,Search,2017,23,Katherine  Hawley,,,10.1093/ACPROF:OSO/9780198732549.003.0014,https://doi.org/10.1093/ACPROF:OSO/9780198732549.003.0014,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d49cb83d734d14ce1bcee687425aae362058e9b5,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/17203/1/Hawley_Trustworthy_Chapter_AAM.pdf,"1. The Significance of Group Trustworthiness We value trustworthiness where we find it, in friends, colleagues, and strangers. This is because it is easier to cooperate with trustworthy individuals than with untrustworthy ones, but also because trustworthiness is appreciated for its own sake. Conversely, we resent untrustworthiness when we encounter it, and try to minimise interaction with untrustworthy individuals. This preference for trustworthiness over untrustworthiness is not limited to our interactions with individuals. Who wouldn’t prefer to work for a trustworthy company, to be treated at a trustworthy hospital, and to vote for a trustworthy political party?",,
Trustworthy systems revisited,Pervasive problems can have immediately obvious consequences.,Search,2006,1,Peter G.

Our lives increasingly depend on critical national infrastructures that depend in varying degrees on the dependable behavior of computer-communication resources, including the Internet and many of its attached computer systems. Unless certain information system resources are trustworthy, our critical systems are at serious risk from failures and subver-sions. Unfortunately, for many of the key application domains, the existing information infrastructures are lacking in trustworthiness. For example, power grids, air-traffic control, high-integrity electronic voting systems, the emerging DoD Global Information Grid, the national infra-structures, and many collaborative and competitive Internet-based applications all need systems that are more trustworthy than we have today. In this column, we have frequently considered risks associated with such systems and what is needed to make them more trustworthy. This month's column takes a higher-level and more intuitive view by considering analogies with our natural environ-ment—expectations for which are rather similar to expectations for trustworthy information systems. For example, pure air and uncontaminated water are vital, as are the social systems that ensure them. Although poorly chosen analogies can be misleading , the analogy with our natural environment seems quite apt. Each of the following bulleted items is applicable to both trustworthy information systems and natural environments. • Their critical importance is generally underappre-ciated until something goes fundamentally wrong—after which undoing the damage can be very difficult if not impossible. • Problems can result from natural circumstances, equipment failures, human errors, malicious activity , or a combination of these and other factors. • Dangerous contaminants may emerge and propagate, often unobserved. Some of these may remain unde-tected for relatively long periods of time, whereas others can have immediately obvious consequences. • Your well-being may be dramatically impeded, but there is not much you as an individual can do about aspects that are pervasive—perhaps international or even global in scope. • Detection, remediation, and prevention require cooperative social efforts, such as public health and sanitation efforts, as well as technological means. • Up-front preventive measures can result in significant savings and increases in human well-being, ameliorating major problems later on. • Once something has gone recognizably wrong, countermeasures are typically fruitless—too …",,

Academia, government, and industry have conducted several efforts with the aim of providing a view of trustworthiness in software from system construction, evaluation and analysis. This paper investigates the previous and present activities that have been performed to achieve software trustworthiness and suggests some guidelines for future activities. The proposed approach uses the novel behaviouristic model for verifying software trustworthiness based on scenarios of interactions between the software and its users and environment [1].",,
A component‐based development process for trustworthy systems,A component-based development process should preserve trustworthiness properties in every activity of every phase of system development.,Search,2012,4,"Mubarak  Mohammad, Vangalur S.

The rationale for our perspective of the process is two‐fold. The activities prescribed in a conventional software engineering development process are neither suitable nor sufficient for developing component‐based systems. Component‐based development methods that are currently practised do not support the explicit specification of trustworthiness properties, and are not based on rigorous principles. Hence they are not suitable for developing trustworthy systems. Trustworthiness is regarded as a composite nonfunctional property comprising the four attributes safety, security, availability, and reliability. They must be rigorously defined for components and systems composed from them. It is essential that the process enforces a direct evidence of trustworthiness in the systems that are developed following the process. Consequently, the development process, in addition to being reuse‐oriented, component‐oriented, and rigorous in all phases of the system lifecycle, should maintain the chain of evidence that the trustworthiness properties are preserved in every activity of every phase of system development. The proposed process includes several parallel interrelated tracks including component development, component assessment, component reuse, and component‐based system development and prescribes specific activities and tools for ensuring trustworthiness in all activities.

It does not reduce to justified or reliable true belief, but figures in the reason why justified or reliable true beliefs are often valuable. Such beliefs can be precarious. If a belief's being justified requires that the evidence be just as we take it to be, then if we are off even by a little, the belief is unwarranted. Similarly for reliability. Although it satisfies the definition of knowledge, such a belief is not trustworthy. We ought not use it as a basis for inference or action and ought not give others to believe it. The trustworthiness of a belief, I urge, depends on its being backed by reasons—considerations that other members of the appropriate epistemic community cannot reasonably reject. Trustworthiness is intersubjective. It both depends on and contributes to the evolving cognitive values of an epistemic community.",,

To address this problem, the University of Oldenburg's TrustSoft Graduate School aims to provide a holistic view of trustworthiness in software - one that considers system construction, evaluation/analysis, and certification - in an interdisciplinary setting. Component technology is the foundation of our research program. The choice of a component architecture greatly influences the resulting software systems' nonfunctional properties. We are developing new methods for the rigorous design of trustworthy software systems with predictable, provable, and ultimately legally certifiable system properties. We are well aware that it is impossible to build completely error-free complex software systems. We therefore complement fault-prevention and fault-removal techniques with fault-tolerance methods that introduce redundancy and diversity into software systems. Quantifiable attributes such as availability, reliability, and performance call for analytical prediction models, which require empirical studies for calibration and validation. To consider the legal aspects of software certification and liability, TrustSoft integrates the disciplines of computer science and computer law.",,

Trustworthiness is a matter of avoiding unfulfilled commitments, which requires both caution in incurring new commitments and diligence in fulfilling existing commitments. On this view, one can be trustworthy regardless of one’s motives for fulfilling one’s commitments. This is a negative account of trustworthiness, which means that one can be trustworthy whilst avoiding commitments as far as possible. In practice, through friendship, work and other social engagements we take on meta-commitments—commitments to incur future commitments. These can make it a matter of trustworthiness to take on certain new commitments. Untrustworthiness can arise from insincerity or bad intentions, but it can also arise from enthusiasm and becoming over-committed. A trustworthy person must not allow her commitments to outstrip her competence.",,

However, if we are to learn how to increase levels of trust in society, we must first understand why people choose to trust others. One potential answer to this is that people view trust as normative: there is a social norm for trusting that imposes punishment for noncompliance. To test this, we report data from a survey with salient rewards to elicit people’s attitudes regarding the punishment of distrusting behavior in a trust game. Our results show that people do not behave as though trust is a norm. Our participants expected that most people would not punish untrusting investors, regardless of whether the potential trustee was a stranger or a friend. In contrast, our participants behaved as though being trustworthy is a norm. Most participants believed that most people would punish someone who failed to reciprocate a stranger’s or a friend’s trust. We conclude that, while we were able to reproduce previous results establishing that there is a norm of reciprocity, we found no evidence for a corresponding norm of trust, even among friends.",,

In addition, when the environment is subject to inherent resource constraints, any efficiency efforts are essentially needed. In light of these two issues, we propose a novel trustworthy-based efficient broadcast scheme in a resource-constrained P2P environment. The trustworthiness is associated with the peer@? s reputation. A peer holds a personalised view of reputation towards other peers in four categories namely SpEed, Correctness, qUality, and Risk-freE (SeCuRE). The value of each category constitutes a fraction of the reliability of individual peer. Another factor that contributes to the reliability of a peer is the peer@? s credibility concerning trustworthiness in providing recommendation about other peers. Our trust management scheme is applied in conjunction with our trust model in order to detect malicious and collaborative-based malicious peers. Knowledge of trustworthiness among peers is used in our proposed broadcast model named trustworthy-based estafet multi-point relays (TEMPR). This model is designed to minimise the communication overhead between peers while considering the trustworthiness of the peers such that only trustworthy peer may relay messages to other peers. With our approach, each peer is able to disseminate messages in the most efficient and reliable manner.",,

Results strongly suggest that the survey question measures differences in caution levels rather than in trust. Implications of this research are discussed.",,
Trustworthy data from untrusted databases,"If a database server is owned by a third party, the server may be compromised, making the data untrusted.",Search,2013,29,"Rohit  Jain, Sunil  Prabhakar",2013 IEEE 29th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE),,10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544853,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544853,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fd25c5bb5ab55b1621fd9f1c4bf9b2cea93430f6,http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/pub/ICDE2013.pdf,"Ensuring the trustworthiness of data retrieved from a database is of utmost importance to users. The correctness of data stored in a database is defined by the faithful execution of only valid (authorized) transactions. In this paper we address the question of whether it is necessary to trust a database server in order to trust the data retrieved from it. The lack of trust arises naturally if the database server is owned by a third party, as in the case of cloud computing. It also arises if the server may have been compromised, or there is a malicious insider. In particular, we reduce the level of trust necessary in order to establish the authenticity and integrity of data at an untrusted server. Earlier work on this problem is limited to situations where there are no updates to the database, or all updates are authorized and vetted by a central trusted entity. This is an unreasonable assumption for a truly dynamic database, as would be expected in many business applications, where multiple clients can update data without having to check with a central server that approves of their changes. We identify the problem of ensuring trustworthiness of data at an untrusted server in the presence of transactional updates that run directly on the database, and develop the first solutions to this problem. Our solutions also provide indemnity for an honest server and assured provenance for all updates to the data. We implement our solution in a prototype system built on top of Oracle with no modifications to the database internals. We also provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed solutions and establish their feasibility.",,
Trust (and mistrust) in secure applications,Trust and trustworthiness are the foundations of security.,Search,2001,103,"John  Viega, Tadayoshi  Kohno, Bruce  Potter",CACM,,10.1145/359205.359223,https://doi.org/10.1145/359205.359223,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2c95a72cd587de1c3addd00cb9356c8f741c0515,,"Trust and trustworthiness are the foundations of security. Homeowners trust lock manufacturers to create quality locks to protect their homes. Some locks are trustworthy; others are not. Businesses trust security guards to admit only authorized personnel into sensitive areas. Some security guards should be trusted; some should not. CGI programmers trust users to provide valid inputs to the data fields on Web pages. Although most users can be trusted, some cannot. The basis for these trust relationships and how they are formed can dramatically affect the underlying security of any system—be it home protection or online privacy. Because these trust assumptions are often illusive, software development efforts seldom handle these assumptions correctly. Several common ways in which erroneous trust assumptions in software applications can wreak havoc on the security of those applications are explored here. We consider the common trust assumptions and why they are often wrong, how these trust assumptions can arise during an application’s development process, and how to minimize the number of problematic trust assumptions in an application. A trust relationship is a relationship involving multiple entities (such as companies, people, or software components). Entities in a relationship trust each other to have or not have certain properties (the so-called trust assumptions). If the trusted entities satisfy these properties, then they are trustworthy. Unfortunately, because these properties are seldom explicitly defined, misguided trust relationships in software applications are not uncommon. Software developers have trust relationships during every stage of software development. Before a software project is conceived, there are business and personal trust relationships that developers generally assume will not be abused. For example, many corporations trust that their employees will not attack the information systems of the company. Because of this trust, a company might have a software application talking to a database over the company’s network without the aid of encryption and authentication. Employees could easily abuse the lack of security to convince database applications to run phony updates. Companies usually trust their software developers and assume their developers will not leave back doors or other artifacts in their code that could potentially compromise the security of the system. System architects must constantly deal with trust issues during an application’s design cycle. Proprietary design documents and other data are often communicated over channels that should not be trusted (such as the Internet); the developer must weigh his or her trust in the people who might have access to this data, John Viega,",,
Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be used for the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

Trustworthiness as an Impression,"Between solution providers and their clients, the suppliers establish their trustworthiness and their trustworthiness is examined by their potential customers.",Search,2008,4,Dominika  Latusek,,,10.4018/978-1-59904-564-1.CH009,https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-59904-564-1.CH009,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e9f82f8a97c99c48423591d571ba982815636027,,"This chapter discusses current developments in the theory of trust and distrust drawing upon a field study between solution providers and their clients in the IT industry in Poland. It addresses the question of how the suppliers (trust-takers) establish the image of being trustworthy, and how their trustworthiness is in turn examined by their potential customers, when cooperation takes place in the context of the openly expressed lack of trust (or distrust). Trust in the chapter is seen as a tranquilizer that suspends the feeling of vulnerability and enables action regardless of uncertainty involved in the situation. Cooperation is understood in dramaturgic terms--the supplier is to produce an impression that will make them appear trustworthy as perceived by the customer.",,
A Computation Model of Trustworthy Degree,Mean 2-form of vector to compute the trustworthy degree is discussed and shown to be reasonable.,Search,2008,4,"Yanfang  Ma, Min  Zhang",2008 International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application Workshops,,10.1109/IITA.WORKSHOPS.2008.164,https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.WORKSHOPS.2008.164,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f4212efbcfedb9b7bfff0d92040d27f604f023dc,,"Trustworthy degree plays an important role in the quantity analysis of trustworthy networks.

On the basis of an assignment of relative trustworthiness to sets of information sources, a lattice of degrees of trustworthiness is constructed; from this, a priority structure is derived and applied to the problem of forming the right opinion. Consolidated with an unquestioned knowledge base, this provides an unambiguous account of what an agent should believe, conditionally on which information sources are trusted. Applications in multi-agent doxastic logic are sketched.",,

to understand how organizations and their leaders earn, maintain and violate trust

theoretical research into the nature, development and repair of trust. In 2011, we

completed a study commissioned by the Institute of Business Ethics of 30 organizations

that had violated trust and then attempted to repair trust (with varying degrees

of success) during the prior 10 yearsii; the study analyzed case study data based on

both archival and interview sources. We have also conducted deep examinations of

two large corporate and government organizations experiencing trust crises. For

obvious reasons, the identity of the organizations must remain confidential. One was

global and headquartered outside the United States; the other was U.S.-based and

operated primarily within the United States. In both cases we had extensive access

to key employees at all levels and collected interview and survey data. We supplemented

the above research with an examination of best practices at select

companies that consistently appear on the “Most Admired” and “Best Companies

to Work For” lists compiled by Fortune magazine and data from several hundred

executives and managers attending executive education leadership programs on the

trust issues they experience in their organizations.",,Review
Trustworthiness in Peer-to-Peer Systems,A peer can collect information on objects distributed in P2P systems through communicating with the acquaintance peers.,Search,2015,1,"Shota  Nakahira, Shigenari  Nakamura, Tomoya  Enokido, Makoto  Takizawa",2015 18th International Conference on Network-Based Information Systems,,10.1109/NBiS.2015.97,https://doi.org/10.1109/NBiS.2015.97,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6172806552fe0d48132bf5e787e15741d4b6f807,,"A peer-to-peer (P2P) system is composed of peer processes (peers) interconnected in overlay networks. A peer has to communicate only with acquaintance peers due to the scalability and autonomy of the P2P system. A peer can collect information on objects distributed in P2P systems through communicating with the acquaintance peers. Peers may hold obsolete information and be faulty. Hence, a peer has to collect information from trustworthy acquaintance peers. The trustworthiness of an acquaintance peer is defined in terms of multiple parameters like response time and number of correct replies. It is difficult to obtain the trustworthiness due to the complex calculation of multiple parameter. In this paper, we discuss trustworthiness of an acquaintance peer in Fuzzy logics.",,

It allows us to reveal vulnerable parts of ourselves to others and to know others intimately in return. A climate of trust eases cooperation among people and fosters reciprocal caretaking. The resources—physical, emotional, economic—that would otherwise be consumed guarding against harm can be directed toward more constructive ends. Here, we explore the nature of trust and how and where it flourishes online. We also seek to make sense of seemingly disparate perceptions. For example, some say the public is too trusting online; without thinking, people routinely download software likely to destroy important information or blithely engage in e-auctions or chat rooms with strangers. Others say the public does not trust enough, that people refrain, for example, from e-commerce under the mistaken belief that their financial transactions are not secure. How can we know if the trust we choose to give or withhold is warranted? Can we trust machines or other technological systems? How can those of us who create and maintain the technological infrastructure help establish a climate of trust? Addressing such questions, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding trust, then offer 10 characteristics of online interaction that can help engineer trust online and distinguish between trust in e-commerce activities and trust in online interpersonal interactions.",,
