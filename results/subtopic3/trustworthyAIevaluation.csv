To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,

Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review
Trustworthiness in Industrial IoT Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence,An automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS was proposed in this article.,Search,2021,81,"Zhihan  Lv, Yang  Han, Amit Kumar Singh, Gunasekaran  Manogaran, Haibin  Lv",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79086f67c5d7413a05305478b1b38781588ed19d,,"The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources.

It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.",,

Such systems provide customers with timely, informed, and customized inferences to aid their decision, while at the same time utilizing appropriate security protection mechanisms for AI models. Additionally, such systems should also use Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to protect customers' data at any time.

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"Current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

I tackle this question by combining AI ethics research with previous research findings to create the Trustworthy AI Implementation (TAII) framework. A literature review was conducted and that specifies the research and implementation status for each process step. The aim is to kickoff AI ethics and to transfer research and abstract guidelines from academia to business. The TAII process generates a meta perspective on the systemic dependencies of ethics for the company ecosystem. It generates orienteering for the AI ethics kickoff without requiring a deep background in philosophy and considers perspectives of social impact outside the software and data engineering setting. Depending on the legal regulation or area of application, the TAII process can be adapted and used with different regulations and ethical principles.",,Review

Their use raises ethical, social and legal issues. Here we demonstrate how the guidelines for trustworthy AI, can assist to answer those ethical issues in the case of clinical trials (CT).

In 2018 the European Commission established the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). The group proposed Guidelines to promote Trustworthy AI, with three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle, as it should be lawful, ethical and robust.

Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for people and societies to develop, and use AI systems. We used a focus group methodology to explore how the guidelines for trustworthy AI can assist to answer the ethical issues that rise by the application of AI in CTs.

The discussion was directed to the seven requirements for trustworthy AI in CTs, by questions like:

Are they relevant in CTs as a whole? Would they be applicable to the use of IIT as AI in CTs? Are you currently applying part, or all, of the proposed list? In the future, would you attach some, or all, of the proposed list? Is the administrative burden of applying the requirements justified by the effect?

It was recommended that:

the guidelines are relevant in the conduct of the CT; planning and implementation of CTs using IIT, should take them into account; ethical aspects and challenges are of the utmost importance; the proposed list is a very comprehensive framework; particular attention should be paid where more vulnerable groups are affected; the administrative burden is acceptable, as the effect exceeds the resources invested.

IIT are becoming increasingly important in medicine, and requirements for trustworthy IIT, and AI are necessary. Appropriate instrument in the case of the CTs are the provided by AI HLEG guidelines.",,
