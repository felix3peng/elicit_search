Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans.,Search,2019,67,Mark O. Riedl,Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies,,10.1002/HBE2.117,https://doi.org/10.1002/HBE2.117,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1fccba11583dc9e1030713d61bd65e9e9990e39f,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/hbe2.117,"Humans are increasingly coming into contact with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them. We further argue that issues of social responsibility such as fairness, accountability, interpretability, and transparency.",,
Human-centered Artificial Intelligence: A Multidimensional Approach towards Real World Evidence,An iterative methodology using hermeneutics outlines the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence.,Search,2019,3,"Bettina  Schneider, Petra Maria Asprion, Frank  Grimberg",ICEIS,,10.5220/0007715503810390,https://doi.org/10.5220/0007715503810390,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f831bf2857fe27c3211f602f2839dec59222f251,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/603b/6573fa4f30d51652c687e3a6ace0bf6d3c01.pdf,"This study indicates the significance of a human-centered perspective in the analysis and interpretation of Real World Data. As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived ‘Health-related Quality of Life’ is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated ‘Real World Evidence’. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modelling techniques. The outcome – a human-centered ‘Indicator Set’ can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives – the elementary, the algorithmic and – as novelty – the human-centered evidence. As conclusion, we claim that Real World Data are more valuable and applicable to achieve patient-centricity and personalization if the human-centered perspective is considered ‘by design’.",,
Human-centered AI: The role of Human-centered Design Research in the development of AI,Humanistic design research should play a vital role in the pan-disciplinary collaboration with technologists and policymakers to mitigate the impact of AI.,Search,2020,12,Jan  Auernhammer,,,10.21606/drs.2020.282,https://doi.org/10.21606/drs.2020.282,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/647e53dbfa26c84eb4908ed67855b167da79398f,https://dl.designresearchsociety.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&context=drs-conference-papers,"Artificial Intelligence has the tremendous potential to produce progress and innovation in society. Designing AI for people has been expressed as essential for societal well-being and the common good. However, human-centered is often used generically without any commitment to a philosophy or overarching approach. This paper outlines different philosophical perspectives and several Human-centered Design approaches and discusses their contribution to the development of Artificial Intelligence. The paper argues that humanistic design research should play a vital role in the pan-disciplinary collaboration with technologists and policymakers to mitigate the impact of AI. Ultimately, Human-centered Artificial Intelligence incorporates involving people and designing Artificial Intelligence systems for people through a genuine human-centered philosophy and approach.",,
Human-Centered AI,"AI systems require the primary users to gain appropriate levels of trust, transparency regarding limitations, and reflective oversight.",Search,2021,4,"Hollen  Barmer, Rachel  Dzombak, Matthew  Gaston, Vijaykumar  Palat, Frank  Redner, Carol  Smith, Tanisha  Smith",,,10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/264b9b136889da3b4d7e50ef58c77678b35dc3e0,,"We identify three specific areas of focus to advance human-centered AI:• Designers and systems must understand the context of use and sense changes over time: Successful AI Engineering depends on the team’s ability to identify and articulate the desired system outcome and understand human and contextual factors affecting the outcome. The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) signifies a specific strategy meant to design smart systems whereby these systems can adapt to specific behaviors with respect to data. In the modern age, humans are rapidly collaborating with ML and AI systems. The AI that is human-based is a perspective of ML and AI, which algorithms have to be established with the awareness that they are a major segment of the massive system incorporating human.

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could support analysts as they perform analysis tasks, to enhance their expertise. However, systems must also be cognisant about how expertise is gained and designed so that this is not impinged. In this paper, we describe the results of Cognitive Task Analysis interviews with 6 experienced intelligence analysts. We capture themes, in terms of their decision making paths during an analysis task, and highlight how each theme is both influenced by expertise and an influence upon expertise. We also identify important interdependencies between themes. We propose that our findings can be used to help design Human-Centered AI (HCAI) systems for supporting intelligence analysts.",,
