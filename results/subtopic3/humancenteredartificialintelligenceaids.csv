The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,
Artificial Intelligence for Smart Systems Critical Analysis of the Human Centered Approach,AI systems that are aware of their interaction with humans are required to be successful and responsible.,Search,2021,,Zoran Galic Hajnal,Journal of Computing and Natural Science,,10.53759/181x/jcns202101013,https://doi.org/10.53759/181x/jcns202101013,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06ebcb128cc429befb8bc063755c7346f5055e6e,http://anapub.co.ke/journals/jcns/jcns_pdf/2021/jcns_volume_1-issue_3/JCNS202101013.pdf,"A program for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is knowledge as intelligent agent, which typically interacts with the ecosystem. This agent is capable of identifying the status of the ecosystem using the sensors before affecting the state via the actuators. We call the smart systems ""agents” whenever they are able to make some decisions on their own with respect on particular goals. On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) signifies a specific strategy meant to design smart systems whereby these systems can adapt to specific behaviors with respect to data. In the modern age, humans are rapidly collaborating with ML and AI systems. The AI that is human-based is a perspective of ML and AI, which algorithms have to be established with the awareness that they are a major segment of the massive system incorporating human. In this paper, we have presented a research that means that AI systems understand humans with respect to their socio-cultural aspects and that AI system assist humans comprehend them. We also present an argument of the challenges of social responsibility e.g. transparency, interpretability, accountability and fairness.",,

Towards Human Centered Ambient Intelligence,"AmI environments can integrate users' capabilities and skills to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma.",Search,2008,4,"Thomas  Plötz, Christian  Kleine-Cosack, Gernot A.

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,
An analysis of expertise in intelligence analysis to support the design of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence,Intelligence analysis involves unpredictable processes and decision making about complex domains where analysts rely upon expertise.,Search,2021,,"Sam  Hepenstal, Leishi  Zhang, B.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems could support analysts as they perform analysis tasks, to enhance their expertise. However, systems must also be cognisant about how expertise is gained and designed so that this is not impinged. In this paper, we describe the results of Cognitive Task Analysis interviews with 6 experienced intelligence analysts. We capture themes, in terms of their decision making paths during an analysis task, and highlight how each theme is both influenced by expertise and an influence upon expertise. We also identify important interdependencies between themes. We propose that our findings can be used to help design Human-Centered AI (HCAI) systems for supporting intelligence analysts.",,

As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived ‘Health-related Quality of Life’ is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated ‘Real World Evidence’. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modelling techniques. The outcome – a human-centered ‘Indicator Set’ can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives – the elementary, the algorithmic and – as novelty – the human-centered evidence. As conclusion, we claim that Real World Data are more valuable and applicable to achieve patient-centricity and personalization if the human-centered perspective is considered ‘by design’.",,

Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for ""Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.",,

Artificial-intelligence aids have been developed to help the analyst in collaboration with the decision maker to solve the problem. The first attempts were based on expert systems. Limitations with these systems led to the development of a natural language understanding system. The way in which the natural language understanding system undertakes the task of aiding problem formulation is described, as well as the structure of the system itself. The role that such a system plays in the overall modelling process is described, with emphasis on limitations of the current system and how these might be overcome in future developments.",,
