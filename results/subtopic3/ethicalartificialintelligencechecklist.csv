Ethics in artificial intelligence: introduction to the special issue,The development of intelligent systems must include ethical considerations to ensure human flourishing and wellbeing.,Search,2018,129,Virginia  Dignum,Ethics and Information Technology,,10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b77b4235bd455cf6df68cfa4fe4e2aa9401d06c,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10676-018-9450-z.pdf,"Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated a steep interest from media and general public. As AI systems (e.g. robots, chatbots, avatars and other intelligent agents) are moving from being perceived as a tool to being perceived as autonomous agents and team-mates, an important focus of research and development is understanding the ethical impact of these systems. What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision? What are the moral, societal and legal consequences of their actions and decisions? Can an AI system be held accountable for its actions? How can these systems be controlled once their learning capabilities bring them into states that are possibly only remotely linked to their initial, designed, setup? Should such autonomous innovation in commercial systems even be allowed, and how should use and development be regulated? These and many other related questions are currently the focus of much attention. The way society and our systems will be able to deal with these questions will for a large part determine our level of trust, and ultimately, the impact of AI in society, and the existence of AI. Contrary to the frightening images of a dystopic future in media and popular fiction, where AI systems dominate the world and is mostly concerned with warfare, AI is already changing our daily lives mostly in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity (Stone et al. 2016). This is the case in domain such as transportation; service robots; health-care; education; public safety and security; and entertainment. Nevertheless, and in order to ensure that those dystopic futures do not become reality, these systems must be introduced in ways that build trust and understanding, and respect human and civil rights. The need for ethical considerations in the development of intelligent interactive systems is becoming one of the main influential areas of research in the last few years, and has led to several initiatives both from researchers as from practitioners, including the IEEE initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Systems1, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics2, and the Partnership on AI3 amongst several others. As the capabilities for autonomous decision making grow, perhaps the most important issue to consider is the need to rethink responsibility (Dignum 2017). Whatever their level of autonomy and social awareness and their ability to learn, AI systems are artefacts, constructed by people to fulfil some goals. Theories, methods, algorithms are needed to integrate societal, legal and moral values into technological developments in AI, at all stages of development (analysis, design, construction, deployment and evaluation). These frameworks must deal both with the autonomic reasoning of the machine about such issues that we consider to have ethical impact, but most importantly, we need frameworks to guide design choices, to regulate the reaches of AI systems, to ensure proper data stewardship, and to help individuals determine their own involvement. Values are dependent on the socio-cultural context (Turiel 2002), and are often only implicit in deliberation processes, which means that methodologies are needed to elicit the values held by all the stakeholders, and to make these explicit can lead to better understanding and trust on artificial autonomous systems. That is, AI reasoning should be able to take into account societal values, moral and ethical considerations; weigh the respective priorities of values held by different stakeholders in various multicultural contexts; explain its reasoning; and guarantee transparency. Responsible Artificial Intelligence is about human responsibility for the development of intelligent systems along fundamental human principles and values, to ensure human flourishing and wellbeing in a sustainable world. In fact, Responsible AI is more than the ticking of some ethical ‘boxes’ in a report, or the development of some add-on features, or switch-off buttons in AI systems. Rather, responsibility is fundamental",,
The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence,Artificial intelligence may be able to achieve superintelligence by increasing processing speed.,Search,2014,224,"Nick  Bostrom, Eliezer  Yudkowsky",,,10.1017/CBO9781139046855.020,https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139046855.020,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/787996496a300356188ba921f02f926331f80a63,http://intelligence.org/files/EthicsofAI.pdf,"This chapter surveys some of the ethical challenges that may arise as one can create artificial intelligences (AI) of various kinds and degrees. Some challenges of machine ethics are much like many other challenges involved in designing machines. There is nearly universal agreement among modern AI professionals that artificial intelligence falls short of human capabilities in some critical sense, even though AI algorithms have beaten humans in many specific domains such as chess. In creating a superhuman chess player, the human programmers necessarily sacrificed their ability to predict Deep Blue's local, specific game behavior. A different set of ethical issues arises when one can contemplate the possibility that some future AI systems might be candidates for having moral status. One also has moral reasons to treat them in certain ways, and to refrain from treating them in certain other ways. Superintelligence may be achievable by increasing processing speed.",,
The EU Approach to Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence,The EU AI HLEG group published its Ethics Guidelines to help achieve “Trustworthy AI”.,Search,2019,56,Nathalie A.

The group was tasked to draft two deliverables: AI Ethics Guidelines and Policy and Investment Recommendations. Nine months later, its first deliverable was published, putting forward a comprehensive framework to achieve “Trustworthy AI” by offering ethical guidance to AI practitioners. This paper dives into the work carried out by the group, focusing in particular on its AI Ethics Guidelines. First, this paper clarifies the context that led to the creation of the AI HLEG and its mandate (I.). Subsequently, it elaborates on the Guidelines’ aim and purpose (II.), and analyses the Guidelines’ drafting process (III.). Particular focus is given to the questions surrounding the respective role played by ethics and law in the AI governance landscape (IV.), as well as some of the challenges that had to be overcome throughout the process (V.). Finally, this paper places the Guidelines in an international context, and sets out the next steps (VI.) ahead on the journey towards an appropriate governance framework for AI (VII.).",,

With a growing demand worldwide for scalable, affordable, and accessible health care solutions, the use of AI offers tremendous potential to improve emotional well-being. To realize this potential, it is imperative that AI service providers prioritize clear and consistent ethical guidelines that align with global considerations regarding user safety and privacy. This report offers a template for an ethical code that can be implemented by other emotional AI services and their affiliates. It includes practical guidelines for integrating support from clients, collaborators, and research partners. It also shows how existing ethical systems can inform the development of AI ethics.",,
Artificial Intelligence: the global landscape of ethics guidelines,A global convergence is emerging around five ethical principles with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted.,Search,2019,228,"Anna  Jobin, Marcello  Ienca, Effy  Vayena",ArXiv,,10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7bf47af1f989c1a999d7dab24d86d19f13e8ba55,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11668,"In the last five years, private companies, research institutions as well as public sector organisations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical AI, yet there is debate about both what constitutes ""ethical AI"" and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analyzed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted; why they are deemed important; what issue, domain or actors they pertain to; and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.",,
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics: Ethics of AI and Ethical AI,AI ethics is still in the infancy stage.,Search,2020,26,"Keng  Siau, Weiyu  Wang",J.

AI promises enormous benefits for economic growth, social development, as well as human well-being and safety improvement. However, the low-level of explainability, data biases, data security, data privacy, and ethical problems of AI-based technology pose significant risks for users, developers, humanity, and societies. As AI advances, one critical issue is how to address the ethical and moral challenges associated with AI. Even though the concept of “machine ethics” was proposed around 2006, AI ethics is still in the infancy stage. AI ethics is the field related to the study of ethical issues in AI. To address AI ethics, one needs to consider the ethics of AI and how to build ethical AI. Ethics of AI studies the ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that are related to AI. Ethical AI is an AI that performs and behaves ethically. One must recognize and understand the potential ethical and moral issues that may be caused by AI to formulate the necessary ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations for AI (i.e., Ethics of AI). With the appropriate ethics of AI, one can then build AI that exhibits ethical behavior (i.e., Ethical AI). This paper will discuss AI ethics by looking at the ethics of AI and ethical AI. What are the perceived ethical and moral issues with AI? What are the general and common ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that can resolve or at least attenuate these ethical and moral issues with AI? What are some of the necessary features and characteristics of an ethical AI? How to adhere to the ethics of AI to build ethical AI?",,

Beyond the promise: implementing ethical AI,"Businesses require strong, mandated governance controls to ensure responsible AI use in enterprises.",Search,2021,19,Ray  Eitel-Porter,AI Ethics,,10.1007/s43681-020-00011-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-020-00011-6,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a7109502e7fe91f4decc3dd3515e1fecbc02da7,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43681-020-00011-6.pdf,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications can and do have unintended negative consequences for businesses if not implemented with care. Specifically, faulty or biased AI applications risk compliance and governance breaches and damage to the corporate brand. These issues commonly arise from a number of pitfalls associated with AI development, which include rushed development, a lack of technical understanding, and improper quality assurance, among other factors. To mitigate these risks, a growing number of organisations are working on ethical AI principles and frameworks. However, ethical AI principles alone are not sufficient for ensuring responsible AI use in enterprises. Businesses also require strong, mandated governance controls including tools for managing processes and creating associated audit trails to enforce their principles. Businesses that implement strong governance frameworks, overseen by an ethics board and strengthened with appropriate training, will reduce the risks associated with AI. When applied to AI modelling, the governance will also make it easier for businesses to bring their AI deployments to scale.",,
Relevance of Ethical Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence - a Survey and Evaluation,Ethics for artificial intelligence is a topic of growing practical relevance.,Search,2019,13,"Lea  Rothenberger, Benjamin  Fabian, Elmar  Arunov",ECIS,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/98a6235dda76a6efe0d15202313c53354fe2606a,,"Ethics for artificial intelligence (AI) is a topic of growing practical relevance. Many people seem to believe that AI could render jobs obsolete in the future. Others wonder who is in charge for the actions of AI systems they encounter. Providing and prioritizing ethical guidelines for AI is therefore an important measure for providing safeguards and increasing the acceptance of this technology. The aim of this research is to survey ethical guidelines for the handling of AI in the ICT industry and evaluate them with respect to their relevance. For this goal, first, an overview of AI ethics is derived from the literature, with a focus on classical Western ethical theories. From this, a candidate set of important ethical guidelines is developed. Then, qualitative interviews with experts are conducted for in-depth feedback and ranking of these guidelines. Furthermore, an online survey is performed in order to more representatively weight the ethical guidelines in terms of importance among a broader audience. Combining both studies, a prioritization matrix is created using the weights from the experts and the survey participants in order to synthesize their votes. Based on this, a ranked catalogue of ethical guidelines for AI is created, and novel avenues for research on AI ethics are presented.",,Review
Towards Establishing Criteria for the Ethical Analysis of Artificial Intelligence,"When considering the role of AI in some specific human activities, the lack of morally relevant features calls for caution.",Search,2020,4,"Michele  Farisco, Kathinka  Evers, Arleen  Salles",Sci.

In this article, we propose a methodological model for a comprehensive ethical analysis of some uses of AI, notably as a replacement of human actors in specific activities. We emphasize the need for conceptual clarification of relevant key terms (e.g., intelligence) in order to undertake such reflection. Against that background, we distinguish two levels of ethical analysis, one practical and one theoretical. Focusing on the state of AI at present, we suggest that regardless of the presence of intelligence, the lack of morally relevant features calls for caution when considering the role of AI in some specific human activities.",,

The most important qualia of AI which makes it different from other advanced technology products is its ability to improve its original program and decision-making algorithms via deep learning abilities. This difference is the reason that AI technology stands out from the ethical issues of other advanced technology artifacts. The ethical issues of AI technology vary from privacy and confidentiality of personal data to ethical status and value of AI entities in a wide spectrum, depending on their capability of deep learning and scope of the domains in which they operate. Developing ethical norms and guidelines for planning, development, production, and usage of AI technology has become an important issue to overcome these problems. In this respect three outstanding documents have been produced: 1. The Montréal Declaration for Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence 2. Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI 3. Asilomar Artificial Intelligence Principles In this study, these three documents will be analyzed with respect to the ethical principles and values they involve, their perspectives for approaching ethical issues, and their prospects for ethical reasoning when one or more of these values and principles are in conflict. Then, the sufficiency of these guidelines for addressing current or prospective ethical issues emerging from the existence of AI technology in medicine will be evaluated. The discussion will be pursued in terms of the ambiguity of interlocutors and efficiency for working out ethical dilemmas occurring in practical life.",,

This article discusses AI in terms of the medical ethics issues involved, both existing and potential. Once artificial intelligence is fully developed within electronic systems, it will afford many useful applications in many sectors ranging from banking, agriculture, medical procedures to military operations, especially by decreasing the involvement of humans in critically dangerous activities. Robots as well as computers themselves are embodiments of values inasmuch as they entail actions and choices, but their practical applications are modelled or programmed by the engineers building the systems. AI will need algorithmic procedures to ensure safety in the implementation of such systems. The AI algorithms written could naturally contain errors that may result in unforeseen consequences and unfair outcomes along economic and racial class lines. It is crucial that measures be taken to monitor technological developments ensuring preventative and precautionary safeguards are in place to safeguard the rights of those involved against direct or indirect coercion. While it is the responsibility of AI researchers to ensure that the future impact is more positive than negative, ethicists and philosophers need to be deeply involved in the development of such technologies from the beginning.",,
