Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be used for the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Trustworthiness in Industrial IoT Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence,An automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS was proposed in this article.,Search,2021,81,"Zhihan  Lv, Yang  Han, Amit Kumar Singh, Gunasekaran  Manogaran, Haibin  Lv",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79086f67c5d7413a05305478b1b38781588ed19d,,"The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources. In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.",,

The proposed metric is a significant step forward in the standardization process of AI systems. It is essential to standardize the AI systems’ trustworthiness, but until now, the standardization efforts remain at the level of high-level principles. The measurement methodology of the proposed includes human experts in the loop, and it is based on our trust management system. Our metric captures and quantifies the system’s transparent evaluation by field experts on as many control points as desirable by the users. We illustrate the trustworthy acceptance metric and its measurement methodology using AI in decision-making scenarios of Food-Energy-Water sectors. However, the proposed metric and its methodology can be easily adapted to other fields of AI applications. We show that our metric successfully captures the aggregated acceptance of any number of experts, can be used to do multiple measurements on various points of the system, and provides confidence values for the measured acceptance.

Such systems provide customers with timely, informed, and customized inferences to aid their decision, while at the same time utilizing appropriate security protection mechanisms for AI models.

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,

These approaches are, however, often model-centric instead of focussing on data and the complex adaptive system that is driven by reputation-based service selection. This entails the risk of unrealistic model assumptions. We outline the requirements for robust probabilistic trust assessment using supervised learning and apply a selection of estimators to a real-world dataset, in order to show the effectiveness of supervised methods. Furthermore, we provide a representational mapping of estimator output to a belief logic representation for the modular integration of supervised methods with other trust assessment methodologies.",,

Thus, the need for dependable AI systems is rapidly growing. In 2018, the European Commission appointed experts to a High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI-HLEG). AI- HLEG defined Trustworthy AI as 1) lawful, 2) ethical, and 3) robust and specified seven corresponding key requirements. To help development organizations, AI-HLEG recently published the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI). We present an illustrative case study from applying ALTAI to an ongoing development project of an Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) that relies on Machine Learning (ML). Our experience shows that ALTAI is largely applicable to ADAS development, but specific parts related to human agency and transparency can be disregarded. Moreover, bigger questions related to societal and environmental impact cannot be tackled by an ADAS supplier in isolation. We present how we plan to develop the ADAS to ensure ALTAI-compliance. Finally, we provide three recommendations for the next revision of ALTAI, i.e., life-cycle variants, domainspecific adaptations, and removed redundancy.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,Comprehensive trustworthy AI systems require a lifecycle that monitors and governs AI systems.,Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), education faces two challenges: reaping the benefits of AI to improve education processes, both in the classroom and at the system level; and preparing students for new skillsets for increasingly automated economies and societies. AI applications are often still nascent, but there are many examples of promising uses that foreshadow how AI might transform education. With regard to the classroom, this paper highlights how AI can accelerate personalised learning, the support of students with special needs. At the system level, promising uses include predictive analysis to reduce dropout, and assessing new skillsets. A new demand for complex skills that are less easy to automate (e.g. higher cognitive skills like creativity and critical thinking) is also the consequence of AI and digitalisation. Reaching the full potential of AI requires that stakeholders trust not only the technology, but also its use by humans. This raises new policy challenges around “trustworthy AI”, encompassing the privacy and security of data, but also possible wrongful uses of data leading to biases against individuals or groups.",,
