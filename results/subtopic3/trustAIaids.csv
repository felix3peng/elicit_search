Automated diagnostic aids: The effects of aid reliability on users' trust and reliance,"People are sensitive to different levels of automation reliability, as well as to subsequent changes in initial reliability.",Search,2001,138,"Douglas A. Wiegmann, A. M. Rich, Hui  Zhang",,,10.1080/14639220110110306,https://doi.org/10.1080/14639220110110306,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/93bfa779321631ac971fd816d3138758d1df0273,,"We examined the effects that different levels of, and changes in, automation reliability have on users' trust of automated diagnostics aids. Participants were presented with a series of testing trials in which they diagnosed the validity of a system failure using only information provided to them by an automated diagnostic aid. The initial reliability of the aid was either 60, 80 or 100% reliable. However, for participants initially provided with the 60%-reliable aid, the accuracy of the aid increased to 80% half way through testing, whereas for those initially provided the 100%-reliable aid, the aid's reliability was reduced to 80%. Aid accuracy remained at 80% throughout testing for participants in the 80%-reliability group. Both subjective measures (i.e. perceived reliability of the aids and subjective confidence ratings) and objective measures of performance (concurrence with the aid's diagnosis and decision times) were examined. Results indicated that users of automated diagnostic aids were sensitive to different levels of aid reliabilities, as well as to subsequent changes in initial aid reliabilities. However, objective performance measures were related to, but not perfectly calibrated with, subjective measures of confidence and reliability estimates. These findings highlight the need to distinguish between automation trust as a psychological construct that can be assessed only through subjective measures and automation reliance that can only be defined in terms of performance data. A conceptual framework for understanding the relationship between trust and reliance is presented.",,
Automation Failures on Tasks Easily Performed by Operators Undermine Trust in Automated Aids,Easy automation errors on tasks easily performed by humans severely degrade trust and reliance.,Search,2006,191,"Poornima  Madhavan, Douglas A. Wiegmann, Frank C. Lacson",Hum.

Background: Research has revealed that the reliability of imperfect automation is frequently misperceived. We examined the manner in which the easiness and type of imperfect automation errors affect trust and dependence. Method: Participants performed a target detection task utilizing an automated aid. In Study 1, the aid missed targets either on easy trials (easy miss group) or on difficult trials (difficult miss group). In Study 2, we manipulated both easiness and type of error (miss vs. false alarm). The aid erred on either difficult trials alone (difficult errors group) or on difficult and easy trials (easy miss group; easy false alarm group). Results: In both experiments, easy errors led to participants mistrusting and disagreeing more with the aid on difficult trials, as compared with those using aids that generated only difficult errors. This resulted in a downward shift in decision criterion for the former, leading to poorer overall performance. Misses and false alarms led to similar effects. Conclusion: Automation errors on tasks that appear “easy” to the operator severely degrade trust and reliance. Application: Potential applications include the implementation of system design solutions that circumvent the negative effects of easy automation errors.",,
Applied artificial intelligence and trust—The case of autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices,Firms must foster trust in applied AI in order to increase acceptance of autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices.,Search,2016,271,"Monika  Hengstler, Ellen  Enkel, Selina  Duelli",,,10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/203b30269d27e158cd26bd1f47c3207f52e6aec8,,"Automation with inherent artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices. However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI.",,
Similarities and differences between human–human and human–automation trust: an integrative review,A theoretical framework synthesizes and describes the process of trust development in humans vs automated aids.,Search,2007,258,"Poornima  Madhavan, Douglas A.

Studies examining the nature of human interaction with automation have revealed that users have a propensity to apply norms of human–human inter-personal interaction to their interaction with ‘intelligent machines’. Nevertheless, there exist subtle differences in the manner in which humans perceive and react to automated aids compared to human team-mates. In the present paper, the concept of trust in human–automation dyads is compared and contrasted with that of human–human dyads. A theoretical framework that synthesizes and describes the process of trust development in humans vs automated aids is proposed and implications for the design of decision aids are provided. Potential implications of this research include the improved design of decision support systems by incorporating features into automated aids that elicit operator responses mirroring responses in human–human inter-personal interaction. Such interventions will likely facilitate better quantification and prediction of human responses to automation, while improving the quality of human interaction with non-human team-mates.",,Review
Effect of confidence and explanation on accuracy and trust calibration in AI-assisted decision making,"Confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making.",Search,2020,98,"Yunfeng  Zhang, Q.

In these scenarios, full automation is often undesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's to ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately calibrate human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for AI-assisted decision making scenarios and invite the research community to explore new approaches to explainability for calibrating human trust in AI.",,
Limits of trust in medical AI,"AI systems can be relied on but cannot be trusted, which may cause a trust deficit in medical relationships.",Search,2020,10,Joshua James Hatherley,Journal of Medical Ethics,,10.1136/medethics-2019-105935,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-105935,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8fd2b272d824d5322928bc40b55c047f35717f8a,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to revolutionise the practice of medicine.

In this paper, I will argue that there is merit to these concerns, since AI systems can be relied on, and are capable of reliability, but cannot be trusted, and are not capable of trustworthiness. Insofar as patients are required to rely on AI systems for their medical decision-making, there is potential for this to produce a deficit of trust in relationships in clinical practice.",,
The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,Trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems.,Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, and several other things.",Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,
How to Evaluate Trust in AI-Assisted Decision Making?

However, empirically investigating trust is challenging. One reason is the lack of standard protocols to design trust experiments. In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods to empirically investigate trust in AI-assisted decision making and analyse the corpus along the constitutive elements of an experimental protocol. We find that the definition of trust is not commonly integrated in experimental protocols, which can lead to findings that are overclaimed or are hard to interpret and compare across studies. Drawing from empirical practices in social and cognitive studies on human-human trust, we provide practical guidelines to improve the methodology of studying Human-AI trust in decision-making contexts. In addition, we bring forward research opportunities of two types: one focusing on further investigation regarding trust methodologies and the other on factors that impact Human-AI trust.",,
Decision support aids with anthropomorphic characteristics influence trust and performance in younger and older adults,AI that embodies human-like characteristics may be useful in situations where there is under-utilization of reasonably reliable aids.,Search,2012,114,"Richard  Pak, Nicole  Fink, Margaux  Price, Brock  Bass, Lindsay  Sturre",Ergonomics,,10.1080/00140139.2012.691554,https://doi.org/10.1080/00140139.2012.691554,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ba0ae1583569d54c6b63b056d98a67f776dd77a8,,"This study examined the use of deliberately anthropomorphic automation on younger and older adults' trust, dependence and performance on a diabetes decision-making task. Research with anthropomorphic interface agents has shown mixed effects in judgments of preferences but has rarely examined effects on performance. Meanwhile, research in automation has shown some forms of anthropomorphism (e.g. etiquette) have effects on trust and dependence on automation. Participants answered diabetes questions with no-aid, a non-anthropomorphic aid or an anthropomorphised aid. Trust and dependence in the aid was measured. A minimally anthropomorphic aide primarily affected younger adults' trust in the aid. Dependence, however, for both age groups was influenced by the anthropomorphic aid. Automation that deliberately embodies person-like characteristics can influence trust and dependence on reasonably reliable automation. However, further research is necessary to better understand the specific aspects of the aid that affect different age groups. Automation that embodies human-like characteristics may be useful in situations where there is under-utilisation of reasonably reliable aids by enhancing trust and dependence in that aid. Practitioner Summary: The design of decision-support aids on consumer devices (e.g. smartphones) may influence the level of trust that users place in that system and their amount of use. This study is the first step in articulating how the design of aids may influence user's trust and use of such systems",,

Trust in artificial intelligence for medical diagnoses.,People have comparable standards of performance for AI and human doctors and that trust in AI does not increase when people are told the AI outperforms the human doctor.,Search,2020,5,"Georgiana  Juravle, Andriana  Boudouraki, Miglena  Terziyska, Constantin  Rezlescu",Progress in brain research,,10.1016/bs.pbr.2020.06.006,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pbr.2020.06.006,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/06f0bb0b40507020a9866dc8f35f5a26700b33af,,"We present two online experiments investigating trust in artificial intelligence (AI) as a primary and secondary medical diagnosis tool and one experiment testing two methods to increase trust in AI. Participants in Experiment 1 read hypothetical scenarios of low and high-risk diseases, followed by two sequential diagnoses, and estimated their trust in the medical findings. In three between-participants groups, the first and second diagnoses were given by: human and AI, AI and human, and human and human doctors, respectively. In Experiment 2 we examined if people expected higher standards of performance from AI than human doctors, in order to trust AI treatment recommendations. In Experiment 3 we investigated the possibility to increase trust in AI diagnoses by: (i) informing our participants that the AI outperforms the human doctor, and (ii) nudging them to prefer AI diagnoses in a choice between AI and human doctors. Results indicate overall lower trust in AI, as well as for diagnoses of high-risk diseases. Participants trusted AI doctors less than humans for first diagnoses, and they were also less likely to trust a second opinion from an AI doctor for high risk diseases. Surprisingly, results highlight that people have comparable standards of performance for AI and human doctors and that trust in AI does not increase when people are told the AI outperforms the human doctor. Importantly, we find that the gap in trust between AI and human diagnoses is eliminated when people are nudged to select AI in a free-choice paradigm between human and AI diagnoses, with trust for AI diagnoses significantly increased when participants could choose their doctor. These findings isolate control over one's medical practitioner as a valid candidate for future trust-related medical diagnosis and highlight a solid potential path to smooth acceptance of AI diagnoses amongst patients.",,

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and investment in AI continues to grow exponentially.AI also poses considerable risks and challenges to society which raises concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO, Australia’s Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on “the essential foundation of trust”. Are we capable of extending our trust to AI? This national survey is the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and understanding community trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide important and timely research insights into the public’s trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems.Key findings include:              - Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by four key drivers;              - Australians have low trust in AI systems but generally ‘accept’ or ‘tolerate’ AI;              - Australians expect AI to be regulated and carefully managed;              - Australians expect organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI;              - Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work;              - Australians want to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses.We draw out the implications of the findings for government, business and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI highlighting three key actions:              - Live up to Australian’s expectations of trustworthy AI              - Strengthen the regulatory framework for governing AI              - Strengthen Australia’s AI literacy",,

In particular, we argue that trust plays a central role for relationships in the healthcare domain, and the introduction of healthcare AI can potentially have significant impacts on those relations of trust. We contend that healthcare AI systems ought to be treated as assistive technologies that go beyond the usual functions of medical devices. As a result, we need to rethink regulation of healthcare AI systems to ensure they advance relevant values. We propose three distinct guidelines that can be universalized across federal regulatory boards to ensure that patient-doctor trust is not detrimentally affected by the deployment and widespread adoption of healthcare AI technologies.",,
