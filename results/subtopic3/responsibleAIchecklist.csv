Ensuring that autonomous systems work responsibly is complex especially when encountering dilemmas. This paper proposes a novel, systematic model checking approach to responsible decision making by a human-agent collective to ensure it is safe, controllable and ethical. Our approach, which is based on the MCMAS model checker, verifies the permissibility of an agent’s actions by checking the decision-making behaviour against the logical formulae specified for safety, controllability and ethical behaviour. The verification results through counterexamples and simulation results can provide a judgement, and an explanation to the AI engineer of the reasons actions are refused or allowed.",,

Responsible AI Tutorial,A key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models.,Search,2022,,"Dr Mukta Paliwal, Dattaraj  Rao, Amogh Kamat Tarcar",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3493700.3493769,https://doi.org/10.1145/3493700.3493769,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04b7d3004cdf971ea05803fbe39c25de561afcc5,,"There is rapid technical progress and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based products and workflows influencing many aspects of human and business activities like banking, healthcare, advertising and many more. Although accuracy of AI models is undoubtedly the most important factor considered while deploying AI based products, there is urgent need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly. Responsible AI is a framework that each software developing organization needs to adapt to build customer trust in the transparency, accountability, fairness, and security of deployed AI solutions. At the same time a key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models. This tutorial will throw light on these aspects of Responsible AI with a working example demonstrating the concept. The intent of the tutorial will be to equip the audience with enough knowledge of the concepts along with code to gain appreciation for the importance of building Responsible AI.",,
Responsible AI: A Primer for the Legal Community,Organizations must confirm AI works as intended and is deployed in a responsible manner to avoid reputational damage.,Search,2020,,"Ilana  Golbin, Anand S.

Applications range from hiring and credit limit decisions, to loan and healthcare claim approvals, to criminal sentencing, and even the selective provision of information by social media companies to different groups of viewers. The increased adoption of AI, affecting so many aspects of our daily lives, highlights the potential risks around automated decision making and the need for better governance and ethical standards when deploying such systems. In response to that need, governments, states, municipalities, private sector organizations, and industry groups around the world have drafted hundreds, perhaps even thousands at this point - of new, regulatory proposals and guidelines; many already in effect and more on the way. The data-driven and often black box nature of these systems does not absolve organizations from the social responsibility or increasingly commonplace regulatory requirements to confirm they work as intended and are deployed in a responsible manner, lest they run the risk of reputational damage, regulatory fines, and/or legal action. The legal community should have a good understanding of the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence in order to inform, translate, and advise on the legal implications of AI systems.",,

Unfortunately, it's difficult to create a set of publication norms for responsible AI because the field of AI is currently fragmented in terms of how this technology is researched, developed, funded, etc. To examine this challenge and find solutions, the Montreal AI Ethics Institute (MAIEI) collaborated with the Partnership on AI in May 2020 to host two public consultation meetups. These meetups examined potential publication norms for responsible AI, with the goal of creating a clear set of recommendations and ways forward for publishers.

In its submission, MAIEI provides six initial recommendations, these include: 1) create tools to navigate publication decisions, 2) offer a page number extension, 3) develop a network of peers, 4) require broad impact statements, 5) require the publication of expected results, and 6) revamp the peer-review process. After considering potential concerns regarding these recommendations, including constraining innovation and creating a ""black market"" for AI research, MAIEI outlines three ways forward for publishers, these include: 1) state clearly and consistently the need for established norms, 2) coordinate and build trust as a community, and 3) change the approach.",,Review

We discuss three notions of responsibility (i.e., blameworthiness, accountability, and liability) for all stakeholders, including AI, and suggest the roles of jurisdiction and the general public in this matter.",,

Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts, such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners' needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We highlight aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of AI fairness checklists, and suggest future design directions.",,
Responsible AI Challenges in End-to-end Machine Learning,Responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together.,Search,2021,,"Steven Euijong Whang, Ki Hyun Tae, Yuji  Roh, Geon  Heo",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0233cd95dd0bc327dd72a14d60216c98021250ab,,"Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision – depth, breadth, and usability – to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.",,

Measures and Best Practices for Responsible AI,"The development of task-specific datasets, metrics, and best practices is essential to the determination of the trustworthiness of machine learning models.",Search,2021,,"Sunipa  Dev, Mehrnoosh  Sameki, Jwala  Dhamala, Cho-Jui  Hsieh",KDD,,10.1145/3447548.3469458,https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3469458,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7b7f889440dd3bbb234ca5a0033b28bef1db0144,,"The use of machine learning (ML) based systems has become ubiquitous including their usage in critical applications like medicine and assistive technologies. Therefore, it is important to determine the trustworthiness of these ML models and tasks. A key component in this determination is the development of task specific datasets, metrics, and best practices which are able to measure the various aspects of responsible model development and deployment including robustness, interpretability and fairness. Further, datasets are also key when training for a given task, be it coreference resolution in language modeling or facial recognition in computer vision. Imbalances and inadequate representation in datasets can have repercussions of an undesirable nature. Some common examples include how coreference resolution systems in NLU are often not all gender inclusive, discrepancies in the measurement of how robust and trustworthy machine predictions are in domains where the selective labels problem is prevalent, and discriminatory determination of pain or care levels of people belonging to different demographics in health science applications. Development of task specific datasets which do better in this regard is also extremely vital. In this workshop, we invite contributions towards different (i) datasets which help enhance task performance and inclusivity, (ii) measures and metrics which help in determining the trustworthiness of a model/dataset, (iii) assessment or remediation tools for fairer, more transparent, robust, and reliable models, and (iv) case studies describing responsible development and deployment of AI systems across fields such as healthcare, financial services, insurance, etc. The datasets, measures, mitigation techniques, and best practices could focus on different areas including (but not restricted to) the following: Fairness and Bias Robustness Reliability and Safety Interpretability Explainability Ethical AI Causal Inference Counterfactual Example Analysis They could also be focussed on the applications in diverse fields such as industry, finance, healthcare and beyond.

Although potential benefits emerged from AI technologies have been widely discussed in many current literature, there is an urgently need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly and act in a manner meeting stakeholders’ expectations and applicable regulations. We seek to fill the gap by exploring the practices of responsible AI and identifying the potential benefits when implementing responsible AI practices. In this study, 10 responsible AI cases were selected from different industries to better understand the use of responsible AI in practices. Four responsible AI practices are identified, including governance, ethically design solutions, risk control and training and education and five strategies for firms who are considering to adopt responsible AI practices are recommended.",,
Responsible AI—Two Frameworks for Ethical Design Practice,The difficulty in moving from principles to practice is a challenge for the implementation of ethical guidelines.,Search,2020,28,"Dorian  Peters, Karina  Vold, Diana  Robinson, Rafael A.

This move came amidst a growing public concern over the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence (AI), compounded by the lack of an anticipatory process for attending to ethical impact within professional practice. However, the difficulty in moving from principles to practice presents a significant challenge to the implementation of ethical guidelines. Herein, we describe two complementary frameworks for integrating ethical analysis into engineering practice to help address this challenge. We then provide the outcomes of an ethical analysis informed by these frameworks, conducted within the specific context of Internet-delivered therapy in digital mental health. We hope both the frameworks and analysis can provide tools and insights, not only for the context of digital healthcare but also for data-enabled and intelligent technology development more broadly.",,

This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens.
