Researchers and developers for HCAI systems value meaningful human control, putting people first by serving human needs, values, and goals.",,
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence: Three Fresh Ideas,"A two-dimensional HCAI framework, a shift from emulating humans to empowering people, and a three-level governance structure can promote trustworthy HCAI systems.",Search,2020,32,Ben  Shneiderman,,,10.17705/1thci.00131,https://doi.org/10.17705/1thci.00131,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/454af1728ba52b16965f7d18fc9301d0ffb6d708,https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=thci,"Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is a promising direction for designing AI systems that support human self-efficacy, promote creativity, clarify responsibility, and facilitate social participation. These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.",,
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,AI systems must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans.,Search,2019,67,Mark O.

Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them. We further argue that issues of social responsibility such as fairness, accountability, interpretability, and transparency.",,

In this paper, we introduce Human-centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) as an approach that puts the human at the center of technology design. It develops a holistic understanding of ""who"" the human is by considering the interplay of values, interpersonal dynamics, and the socially situated nature of AI systems. In particular, we advocate for a reflective sociotechnical approach. We illustrate HCXAI through a case study of an explanation system for non-technical end-users that shows how technical advancements and the understanding of human factors co-evolve. Building on the case study, we lay out open research questions pertaining to further refining our understanding of ""who"" the human is and extending beyond 1-to-1 human-computer interactions. Finally, we propose that a reflective HCXAI paradigm-mediated through the perspective of Critical Technical Practice and supplemented with strategies from HCI, such as value-sensitive design and participatory design--not only helps us understand our intellectual blind spots, but it can also open up new design and research spaces.",,
Human-Centered AI,"AI systems require the primary users to gain appropriate levels of trust, transparency regarding limitations, and reflective oversight.",Search,2021,4,"Hollen  Barmer, Rachel  Dzombak, Matthew  Gaston, Vijaykumar  Palat, Frank  Redner, Carol  Smith, Tanisha  Smith",,,10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/264b9b136889da3b4d7e50ef58c77678b35dc3e0,,"We identify three specific areas of focus to advance human-centered AI:• Designers and systems must understand the context of use and sense changes over time: Successful AI Engineering depends on the team’s ability to identify and articulate the desired system outcome and understand human and contextual factors affecting the outcome. The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,

How to center AI on humans,AI can be human-centered by emulating human intelligence such that it can center its activity and reasoning on its human users.,Search,2020,1,"Frank  Dignum, Virginia  Dignum",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/001d4ec84341de6c75a3ef4fffc6b77409979818,,"In this position paper we investigate what it means for AI to be human-centered. Although many organisations and researchers by now have given requirements for human-centeredness, such as: transparancy, respect for human autonomy, fairness and accountability, this does little to indicate how the AI techniques should be designed in order to be human-centered. In this paper we argue that human-centered AI involves a shift from AI emulating intelligent human tasks, to emulating human intelligence such that we capture enough social intelligence in order for the AI system to be able to center its activity and reasoning on its human users.",,

The paper argues that humanistic design research should play a vital role in the pan-disciplinary collaboration with technologists and policymakers to mitigate the impact of AI. Ultimately, Human-centered Artificial Intelligence incorporates involving people and designing Artificial Intelligence systems for people through a genuine human-centered philosophy and approach.",,

The AI techniques built for supporting DS works are collectively referred to as AutoML systems, and their goals are to automate some parts of the DS workflow. We illustrate a three-step systematical research approach (i.e., explore, build, and integrate) and four practical ways of implementation for HCAI systems.

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,

Human-Centered Explainable AI (XAI): From Algorithms to User Experiences,AI explainability has become an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI.,Search,2021,1,"Q. Vera Liao, Kush R. Varshney",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f7df8011ce143735b95c62103f76f5a3d9e58ab2,,"(Book Chapter Draft 10/2021) As a technical sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI) has produced a vast collection of algorithms, providing a toolbox for researchers and practitioners to build XAI applications. With the rich application opportunities, explainability has moved beyond a demand by data scientists or researchers to comprehend the models they develop, to become an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI deployed in numerous domains. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter, we begin with a high-level overview of the technical landscape of XAI algorithms, then selectively survey our own and other recent HCI works that take human-centered approaches to design, evaluate, provide conceptual and methodological tools for XAI. We ask the question “what are human-centered approaches doing for XAI” and highlight three roles that they play in shaping XAI technologies by helping navigate, assess and expand the XAI toolbox: to drive technical choices by users’ explainability needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods and inform new methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.",,Review
