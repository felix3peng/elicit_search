Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be used for the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
An agile framework for trustworthy AI,The AI High Level Expert Group guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems.,Search,2020,2,"Stefan  Leijnen, Huib  Aldewereld, Rudy van Belkom, Roland  Bijvank, Roelant  Ossewaarde",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880049a16c8fea47dcfe07450668f5507db5e96d,,"From the article: The ethics guidelines put forward by the AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) present a list of seven key requirements that Human-centered, trustworthy AI systems should meet. These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,There is a need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.,Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Traceability for Trustworthy AI: A Review of Models and Tools,A common approach and shared semantics are lacking for reproducibility tools.,Search,2021,3,"Marçal Mora Cantallops, Salvador  Sánchez-Alonso, Elena García Barriocanal, Miguel-Ángel  Sicilia",Big Data Cogn.

Traceability in AI shares part of its scope with general purpose recommendations for provenance as W3C PROV, and it is also supported to different extents by specific tools used by practitioners as part of their efforts in making data analytic processes reproducible or repeatable. Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review

Many efficiencies and improvements are likely, but there are also potential dangers, including the threat of harmful impacts on third parties, discriminatory practices, data and privacy breaches, fraudulent practices and even ‘rogue AI’. To address these dangers, the EU published its 'Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI’. The Guidelines produce seven principles from its four foundational pillars of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness and explicability.

If implemented by business, the impact on corporate governance will be substantial. Fundamental questions at the intersection of ethics and law are considered but, because the Guidelines only address the former without much reference to the latter, their practical application is challenging for business. Further, while they promote many positive corporate governance principles, it is clear that the Guidelines' general nature leaves many questions and concerns unanswered.

In this paper we examine the potential significance and impact of the Guidelines on selected corporate law and governance issues. We conclude that more specificity is needed in relation to how the principles therein will harmonise with company law rules and governance practices. However, despite their imperfections, until harder legislative instruments emerge, the Guidelines provide a useful starting point for directing businesses towards establishing trustworthy AI.",,

Their use raises ethical, social and legal issues. Here we demonstrate how the guidelines for trustworthy AI, can assist to answer those ethical issues in the case of clinical trials (CT).

In 2018 the European Commission established the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). The group proposed Guidelines to promote Trustworthy AI, with three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle, as it should be lawful, ethical and robust.

Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for people and societies to develop, and use AI systems. We used a focus group methodology to explore how the guidelines for trustworthy AI can assist to answer the ethical issues that rise by the application of AI in CTs.

The discussion was directed to the seven requirements for trustworthy AI in CTs, by questions like:

Are they relevant in CTs as a whole? Would they be applicable to the use of IIT as AI in CTs? Are you currently applying part, or all, of the proposed list? In the future, would you attach some, or all, of the proposed list? Is the administrative burden of applying the requirements justified by the effect?

It was recommended that:

the guidelines are relevant in the conduct of the CT; planning and implementation of CTs using IIT, should take them into account; ethical aspects and challenges are of the utmost importance; the proposed list is a very comprehensive framework; particular attention should be paid where more vulnerable groups are affected; the administrative burden is acceptable, as the effect exceeds the resources invested.

IIT are becoming increasingly important in medicine, and requirements for trustworthy IIT, and AI are necessary. Appropriate instrument in the case of the CTs are the provided by AI HLEG guidelines.",,

Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems.

We highlight the responsibilities of funding bodies to ensure investment is channelled towards trustworthy and safe AI systems and provides case studies as to how other ethical funding principles are managed. We offer a first sight of two proposals for funding bodies to consider regarding procedures they can employ. The first proposal is for the inclusion of a Trustworthy AI Statement’ section in the grant application form and offers an example of the associated guidance. The second proposal outlines the wider management requirements of a funding body for the ethical review and monitoring of funded projects to ensure adherence to the proposed ethical strategies in the applicants Trustworthy AI Statement. The anticipated outcome for such proposals being employed would be to create a ‘stop and think’ section during the project planning and application procedure requiring applicants to implement the methods for the ethically aligned design of AI. In essence it asks funders to send the message “if you want the money, then build trustworthy AI!”.",,Review
