Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be applied to the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

The main goal of this paper is to understand what really makes an Artificial Intelligence system trustworthy.",,
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence and Process Mining: Challenges and Opportunities,"Process mining can provide for an automated approach to analyze, remediate, and monitor uncertainty in AI regulatory compliance processes.",Search,2021,,"Andrew  Pery, Majid  Rafiei, Michael  Simon, Wil M.P. van der Aalst",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cdaf33302d24c9f2830bdf19e5b7e83e5a8acd9f,,"The premise of this paper is that compliance with Trustworthy AI governance best practices and regulatory frameworks is an inherently fragmented process spanning across diverse organizational units, external stakeholders, and systems of record, resulting in process uncertainties and in compliance gaps that may expose organizations to reputational and regulatory risks. Moreover, there are complexities associated with meeting the specific dimensions of Trustworthy AI best practices such as data governance, conformance testing, quality assurance of AI model behaviors, transparency, accountability, and confidentiality requirements. These processes involve multiple steps, hand-offs, re-works, and human-in-the-loop oversight. In this paper, we demonstrate that process mining can provide a useful framework for gaining fact-based visibility to AI compliance process execution, surfacing compliance bottlenecks, and providing for an automated approach to analyze, remediate and monitor uncertainty in AI regulatory compliance processes.",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Education: Pitfalls and Pathways,The Ethics Guidelines of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI outline the main pitfalls of AI education.,Search,2020,,Nathalie A.

This development was further spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, which rendered many educational institutions dependent on (AI-enabled) digital learning tools to continue their activities. While the use of AI systems can lead to numerous benefits, it can also entail ethical risks, which are increasingly appearing on legislators’ agendas. Many of these risks are context-specific and increase in significance when vulnerable individuals are involved, asymmetries of power exist, or human rights and democratic values are at stake more generally. Surprisingly, however, regulators have thus far paid only little attention to the specific risks arising in the context of Artificial Intelligence in education (AIED). This paper hence aims to assess the ethical challenges posed by AIED. Its normative framework consists of the seven requirements for Trustworthy AI, as set out in the Ethics Guidelines of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI. After an overview of the broader context in which these requirements took shape (Section 2), the paper examines each requirement in the educational realm, as well as the pitfalls that should be addressed to enable their realisation (Section 3). Particular attention is given to the special role of education in shaping people’s minds, and the manner in which this role can be used both to empower and exploit individuals. The paper notes that AIED’s main strengths – offering education on a wider scale, through more flexible and individualised learning methods, and through the closer monitoring of students’ reception of the materials – are also its main liabilities when left unchecked. Finally, the paper discusses various pathways that policymakers should consider to foster Trustworthy AIED beyond the adoption of guidelines (Section 4), before concluding (Section 5).",,Review

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"A systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, may improve AI trustworthiness.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Trustworthy AI,A required feature of an AI system is to assign appropriate credit to data sources.,Search,2021,,"Richa  Singh, Mayank  Vatsa, Nalini  Ratha",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f52a1c995d5b7ba2be6d419146dbf9ee6b0316c,,"Modern AI systems are reaping the advantage of novel learning methods. With their increasing usage, we are realizing the limitations and shortfalls of these systems. Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

Traceability in AI shares part of its scope with general purpose recommendations for provenance as W3C PROV, and it is also supported to different extents by specific tools used by practitioners as part of their efforts in making data analytic processes reproducible or repeatable. Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review

Those outside of a given organization also need effective means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of AI systems.

Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective.
