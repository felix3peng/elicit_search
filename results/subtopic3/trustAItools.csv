TrustyAI Explainability Toolkit,The TrustyAI initiative looks into explainable artificial intelligence solutions to address trustworthiness in machine learning.,Search,2021,,"Rob  Geada, Tommaso  Teofili, Rui  Vieira, Rebecca  Whitworth, Daniele  Zonca",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b915cbc9d5c9f5c063b6f76a71e8d0b151d066c5,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly more popular and can be found in workplaces and homes around the world. However, how do we ensure trust in these systems? Regulation changes such as the GDPR mean that users have a right to understand how their data has been processed as well as saved. Therefore if, for example, you are denied a loan you have the right to ask why. This can be hard if the method for working this out uses “black box” machine learning techniques such as neural networks. TrustyAI is a new initiative which looks into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) solutions to address trustworthiness in ML as well as decision services landscapes. In this paper we will look at how TrustyAI can support trust in decision services and predictive models. We investigate techniques such as LIME, SHAP and counterfactuals, benchmarking both LIME and counterfactual techniques against existing implementations. We also look into an extended version of SHAP, which supports background data selection to be evaluated based on quantitative data and allows for error bounds.",,
Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be applied to the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations.

The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Transparency and trust in artificial intelligence systems,Transparency can have a negative impact on trust in AI systems.,Search,2020,20,"Philipp  Schmidt, Felix  Bießmann, Timm  Teubner",J. Decis.

Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology.",,

Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review
The relationship between trust in AI and trustworthy machine learning technologies,"Trustworthiness technologies can support the required qualities of fair, explainable, auditable, and safe machine learning.",Search,2020,50,"Ehsan  Toreini, Mhairi  Aitken, Kovila  Coopamootoo, Karen  Elliott, Carlos Gonzalez Zelaya, Aad van Moorsel",FAT*,,10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://doi.org/10.1145/3351095.3372834,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bd4cf5a6987ef0f39b7e4e88d59b3a3365abcc70,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.00782,"To design and develop AI-based systems that users and the larger public can justifiably trust, one needs to understand how machine learning technologies impact trust. To guide the design and implementation of trusted AI-based systems, this paper provides a systematic approach to relate considerations about trust from the social sciences to trustworthiness technologies proposed for AI-based services and products. We start from the ABI+ (Ability, Benevolence, Integrity, Predictability) framework augmented with a recently proposed mapping of ABI+ on qualities of technologies that support trust. We consider four categories of trustworthiness technologies for machine learning, namely these for Fairness, Explainability, Auditability and Safety (FEAS) and discuss if and how these support the required qualities. Moreover, trust can be impacted throughout the life cycle of AI-based systems, and we therefore introduce the concept of Chain of Trust to discuss trustworthiness technologies in all stages of the life cycle. In so doing we establish the ways in which machine learning technologies support trusted AI-based systems. Finally, FEAS has obvious relations with known frameworks and therefore we relate FEAS to a variety of international 'principled AI' policy and technology frameworks that have emerged in recent years.",,
Applied artificial intelligence and trust—The case of autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices,Firms must foster trust in applied AI in order to increase acceptance of AI tools.,Search,2016,271,"Monika  Hengstler, Ellen  Enkel, Selina  Duelli",,,10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2015.12.014,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/203b30269d27e158cd26bd1f47c3207f52e6aec8,,"Automation with inherent artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly emerging in diverse applications, for instance, autonomous vehicles and medical assistance devices.

Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, and several other things.",Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,

On the other hand, the potential threats pose by AI and the possible social upheavals should not be overlooked. The fatal crash of self-driving cars, the data breach of famous websites, and the potential unemployment of cab and truck drivers are hindering human’s trust and acceptance of this new technology.

However, AI has also been implicated in high profile breaches of trust or ethical standards, and concerns have been raised over the use of AI in initiatives and technologies that could be inimical to society. Public trust and perceptions of AI trustworthiness underpin AI systems’ social licence to operate, and a myriad of company, industry, governmental and intergovernmental reports have set out principles for ethical and trustworthy AI. To guide the responsible stewardship of AI into our society, a firm foundation of research on trust in AI to enable evidence-based policy and practice is required. However, in order to inform and guide future research, it is imperative to first take stock and understand what is already know about human trust in AI. As such, we undertake a review of 100 papers examining the relationship between trust and AI. We found a fragmented, disjointed and siloed literature with an empirical emphasis on experimentation and surveys relating to specific AI technologies. While findings suggest some convergence on the importance of explainability as a determinant of trust in AI technologies, there are still gaps between conceptual arguments and what has been examined empirically. We urge future research to take a more holistic approach and investigate how trust in different referents impacts on attitudinal and behavioural intentions. Doing so will facilitate a more nuanced understanding of what it means to develop trustworthy AI.",,Review

The present meta-analysis sought to determine significant factors that predict trust in artificial intelligence (AI). Such factors were divided into those relating to (a) the human trustor, (b) the AI trustee, and (c) the shared context of their interaction.

BACKGROUND

There are many factors influencing trust in robots, automation, and technology in general, and there have been several meta-analytic attempts to understand the antecedents of trust in these areas. However, no targeted meta-analysis has been performed examining the antecedents of trust in AI.

METHOD

Data from 65 articles examined the three predicted categories, as well as the subcategories of human characteristics and abilities, AI performance and attributes, and contextual tasking. Lastly, four common uses for AI (i.e., chatbots, robots, automated vehicles, and nonembodied, plain algorithms) were examined as further potential moderating factors.

RESULTS

Results showed that all of the examined categories were significant predictors of trust in AI as well as many individual antecedents such as AI reliability and anthropomorphism, among many others.

CONCLUSION

Overall, the results of this meta-analysis determined several factors that influence trust, including some that have no bearing on AI performance. Additionally, we highlight the areas where there is currently no empirical research.

APPLICATION

Findings from this analysis will allow designers to build systems that elicit higher or lower levels of trust, as they require.",,Meta-Analysis

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and investment in AI continues to grow exponentially.AI also poses considerable risks and challenges to society which raises concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO, Australia’s Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on “the essential foundation of trust”. Are we capable of extending our trust to AI? This national survey is the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and understanding community trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide important and timely research insights into the public’s trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems.Key findings include:              - Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by four key drivers;              - Australians have low trust in AI systems but generally ‘accept’ or ‘tolerate’ AI;              - Australians expect AI to be regulated and carefully managed;              - Australians expect organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI;              - Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work;              - Australians want to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses.We draw out the implications of the findings for government, business and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI highlighting three key actions:              - Live up to Australian’s expectations of trustworthy AI              - Strengthen the regulatory framework for governing AI              - Strengthen Australia’s AI literacy",,
