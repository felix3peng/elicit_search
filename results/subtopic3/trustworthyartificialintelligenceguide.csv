The Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI – A Procrastination of Effective Law Enforcement,The Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence by the EU Commission are ineffective.,Search,2019,2,Ramak Molavi Vasse’i,Computer Law Review International,,10.9785/cri-2019-200502,https://doi.org/10.9785/cri-2019-200502,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/64223e4aa1a20a6406cd036417245385b6b33cc0,,"In the august issue of the CRi, Nathalie Smuha, the coordinator of the work of the High-Level Expert Group on AI, outlined the approach and considerations leading to the “The EU Approach to Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. This paper provides a critical assessment of the Ethical Guidelines of the EU Commission and points out why a law enforcement focused approach must be the essential next step towards a beneficial and humane development of AI. Questioning the diversity of the Commssion’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, the dangers of ethics shopping are exposed as well as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights explored as already well established alternative reference framework for AI. Having exposed the need for effective red lines, not only the hidden social and ecological cost are assessed, but also the risk of “buying-out” research and other ethical issues neglected in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. Finally, three key weaknesses concerning the crucial translation of ethical principles into practice (enforcement) are highlighted.",,
How to achieve trustworthy artificial intelligence for health,"The EU's guidance leaves room for local, contextualized discretion in the global health sector.",Search,2020,15,"Kristine  Bærøe, Ainar  Miyata-Sturm, Edmund  Henden",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,,10.2471/BLT.19.237289,https://doi.org/10.2471/BLT.19.237289,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0a3c92d6c4fa4670743fb13758916067e772a143,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7133476?pdf=render,"Abstract Artificial intelligence holds great promise in terms of beneficial, accurate and effective preventive and curative interventions. At the same time, there is also awareness of potential risks and harm that may be caused by unregulated developments of artificial intelligence. Guiding principles are being developed around the world to foster trustworthy development and application of artificial intelligence systems. These guidelines can support developers and governing authorities when making decisions about the use of artificial intelligence. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission launched the report Ethical guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence in2019. The report aims to contribute to reflections and the discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies also beyond the countries of the European Union (EU). In this paper, we use the global health sector as a case and argue that the EU’s guidance leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally. We point to the urgency of shared globalized efforts to safeguard against the potential harms of artificial intelligence technologies in health care.",,
Trustworthy AI Development Guidelines for Human System Interaction,"AI development guidelines can improve the user trust in AI systems, enabling human interaction.",Search,2020,3,"Chathurika S.

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,
Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI Systems,"A well-established set of design methodologies is a fundamental prerequisite for the development of high-performing, trustworthy, intelligent systems.",Search,2020,,"Zahoor ul Islam, Andreas  Theodorou, Juan Carlos Nieves, Virginia  Dignum",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6346b968624cca5d4e2f3a53ab53abfd97052ef5,,"In order to engineer human-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems, comply with societal norms, ethical guidelines, and established standards, a well-established set of the development life cycle is needed. This development life cycle requires a continuous evaluation process for continuously evolving AI systems [9]. Furthermore, a strategy is required to initiate human responsibility in the development of AI systems from the start of the life cycle, address the gaps that emerge from the increased automation of decision, and provide tools to fill the gaps. [25]. A possible way to develop ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI systems from a development perspective is to look into software engineering (SE) domain. Software Development life cycle (SDLC) is defined by IEEE as “the process by which user needs are translated into a software product. The process involves translating user needs into software requirements, transforming the software requirements into design, implementing the design in code, testing the code, and sometimes, installing and checking out the software for operational use.” [13]. Some of the most commonly used SDLC models is the waterfall, incremental, prototype-driven, evolutionary, spiral and agile software development methods [23]. Most SDLCs processes are available in all methodologies but applied and practised differently based on projects, problems and personal needs. The rapid development in machine learning and neural networks has enabled machines and algorithms to effectively manage tasks such as natural language processing, translations, stock market predictions, and route planning and optimisation. AI systems can learn quickly from patterns and propose decisions and in some instances, autonomously take decisions but without paying in particular attention to the implications of those decisions. Therefore, applying SE methodologies is a fundamental prerequisite for delivering high quality, responsible, transparent, trustworthy, accountable, and robust smart software applications. A well-established set of design methodologies has the potential to address many of the challenges of designing high-performing trustworthy intelligent systems. It can provide an explicit process for values elicitation and stakeholder involvement in the development of AI systems [9]. It can provide support for effective communication, re-usability, process enhancement, and process management. This methodology can help to maintain explicit formal links between values, norms, and systems functionalities that enable adaptation of the system to evolve perception and justification of implementation de-",,
Trusted Artificial Intelligence: Technique Requirements and Best Practices,"Trusted AI should be based on ethical principles, which can combat information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy issues.",Search,2021,,"Tao  Zhang, Yi  Qin, Qiang  Li",2021 International Conference on Cyberworlds (CW),,10.1109/CW52790.2021.00058,https://doi.org/10.1109/CW52790.2021.00058,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b62d643afc5f3ee16ebf26bf33b1d100685cfe15,,"The development and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have brought numerous problems and potential threats, such as information cocoons, algorithmic collusion, algorithmic bias and privacy, issues. To combat these issues, governments all over the world, international organizations and giant tech companies all have taken actions and reached an agreement that AI should be trusted. However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.",,
Trustworthy artificial intelligence,A data-driven research framework for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) is useful for researching TAI.,Search,2021,21,"Scott  Thiebes, Sebastian  Lins, Ali  Sunyaev",Electron.

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,

The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"A comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems is offered, including from data acquisition to model development.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Trust in Artificial Intelligence: What do we know and why is it important?,A firm foundation of research on trust in AI is required to guide evidence-based policy and practice.,Search,2020,,Steve  Lockey,,,10.37421/JTSM.2020.9.207,https://doi.org/10.37421/JTSM.2020.9.207,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1a2bf8b563290014a4375cee463f4bd4f34bfa45,,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our society is becoming ubiquitous and undoubtedly holds much promise. However, AI has also been implicated in high profile breaches of trust or ethical standards, and concerns have been raised over the use of AI in initiatives and technologies that could be inimical to society. Public trust and perceptions of AI trustworthiness underpin AI systems’ social licence to operate, and a myriad of company, industry, governmental and intergovernmental reports have set out principles for ethical and trustworthy AI. To guide the responsible stewardship of AI into our society, a firm foundation of research on trust in AI to enable evidence-based policy and practice is required. However, in order to inform and guide future research, it is imperative to first take stock and understand what is already know about human trust in AI. As such, we undertake a review of 100 papers examining the relationship between trust and AI. We found a fragmented, disjointed and siloed literature with an empirical emphasis on experimentation and surveys relating to specific AI technologies. While findings suggest some convergence on the importance of explainability as a determinant of trust in AI technologies, there are still gaps between conceptual arguments and what has been examined empirically. We urge future research to take a more holistic approach and investigate how trust in different referents impacts on attitudinal and behavioural intentions. Doing so will facilitate a more nuanced understanding of what it means to develop trustworthy AI.",,Review

We use the extended Brunswik lens model as a framework to illustrate the distinctions between policy analysis and decision making as we have traditionally understood and practiced them and how they are evolving in the current AI context along with the challenges this poses for the use of trustworthy AI. We offer a set of recommendations for practices, processes, and governance structures in government to provide for trust in AI and suggest lines of research that support them.",,
Trustworthy AI,"The Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions,  the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance are some of the most prominent limitations of AI systems.",Search,2021,,"Richa  Singh, Mayank  Vatsa, Nalini  Ratha",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f52a1c995d5b7ba2be6d419146dbf9ee6b0316c,,"Modern AI systems are reaping the advantage of novel learning methods.

Trusted Artificial Intelligence: Towards Certification of Machine Learning Applications,The TÜV AUSTRIA Group in cooperation with the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University Linz proposes a certification process and an audit catalog for Machine Learning applications.,Search,2021,1,"Philip Matthias Winter, Sebastian  Eder, Johannes  Weissenbock, Christoph  Schwald, Thomas  Doms, Tom  Vogt, Sepp  Hochreiter, Bernhard  Nessler",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/86819a944dbd083caa0f968e5fdb533ac9b5dcc7,,"Artificial Intelligence is one of the fastest growing technologies of the 21st century and accompanies us in our daily lives when interacting with technical applications. However, reliance on such technical systems is crucial for their widespread applicability and acceptance. The societal tools to express reliance are usually formalized by lawful regulations, i.e., standards, norms, accreditations, and certificates. Therefore, the TÜV AUSTRIA Group in cooperation with the Institute for Machine Learning at the Johannes Kepler University Linz, proposes a certification process and an audit catalog for Machine Learning applications. We are convinced that our approach can serve as the foundation for the certification of applications that use Machine Learning and Deep Learning, the techniques that drive the current revolution in Artificial Intelligence. While certain high-risk areas, such as fully autonomous robots in workspaces shared with humans, are still some time away from certification, we aim to cover low-risk applications with our certification procedure. Our holistic approach attempts to analyze Machine Learning applications from multiple perspectives to evaluate and verify the aspects of secure software development, functional requirements, data quality, data protection, and ethics. Inspired by existing work, we introduce four criticality levels to map the criticality of a Machine Learning application regarding the impact of its decisions on people, environment, and organizations. Currently, the audit catalog can be applied to low-risk applications within the scope of supervised learning as commonly encountered in industry. Guided by field experience, scientific developments, and market demands, the audit catalog will be extended and modified accordingly.",,
