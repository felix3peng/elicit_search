A Scenario-Based Method for Safety Certification of Artificial Intelligent Software,Safety certification of AI modules requires their AI modules to be evaluated before safety critical systems are invoked.,Search,2010,2,"Guoqi  Li, Minyan  Lu, Bin  Liu",2010 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computational Intelligence,,10.1109/AICI.2010.339,https://doi.org/10.1109/AICI.2010.339,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6091d3429b8e1b88bc37a766129a1c0ae5089d4a,,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is attractive for safety critical fields. However, there have been few success cases, for the AI technique is usually lack of determinism and predictability, which is usually regarded as a disqualifier in a safety on text. Increased researches and supererogatory efforts are providing to incorporate AI into the safety-critical systems in recent years. In this paper, we present a scenario-based method for safety certification, with the method AI modules of system could be evaluated before invoked, if its trust ability is satisfied, then the program will be performed for safety critical systems, otherwise it will be terminated to ask human assistance or postpone the missions.",,
AI Safety Gridworlds,AI safety problems can be categorized into problems of robustness and problems of specification.,Search,2017,141,"Jan  Leike, Miljan  Martic, Victoria  Krakovna, Pedro A. Ortega, Tom  Everitt, Andrew  Lefrancq, Laurent  Orseau, Shane  Legg",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d09bec5af4eef5038e48b26b6c14098f95997114,,"We present a suite of reinforcement learning environments illustrating various safety properties of intelligent agents. These problems include safe interruptibility, avoiding side effects, absent supervisor, reward gaming, safe exploration, as well as robustness to self-modification, distributional shift, and adversaries. To measure compliance with the intended safe behavior, we equip each environment with a performance function that is hidden from the agent. This allows us to categorize AI safety problems into robustness and specification problems, depending on whether the performance function corresponds to the observed reward function. We evaluate A2C and Rainbow, two recent deep reinforcement learning agents, on our environments and show that they are not able to solve them satisfactorily.",,

Safe AI for CPS (Invited Paper),Combining formal proofs with reinforcement learning can help develop safe artificial intelligence for cyber-physical systems.,Search,2018,5,"Nathan  Fulton, André  Platzer",2018 IEEE International Test Conference (ITC),,10.1109/TEST.2018.8624774,https://doi.org/10.1109/TEST.2018.8624774,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03fce03060f6110b2772958f58539320bab519ed,,"Autonomous cyber-physical systems-such as self-driving cars and autonomous drones-often leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to act well in open environments. Although testing plays an important role in ensuring safety and robustness, modern autonomous systems have grown so complex that achieving safety via testing alone is intractable. Formal verification reduces this testing burden by ruling out large classes of errant behavior at design time. This paper reviews recent work toward developing formal methods for cyber-physical systems that use AI for planning and control by combining the rigor of formal proofs with the flexibility of reinforcement learning.",,Review
Safe and sound - artificial intelligence in hazardous applications,Computer science and artificial intelligence are increasingly used in the hazardous and uncertain realms of medical decision making.,Search,2000,272,"John  Fox, Subrata Kumar Das",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f62d215d4c40d299929d2e7fa105d54623a9e1bf,,"Computer science and artificial intelligence are increasingly used in the hazardous and uncertain realms of medical decision making, where small faults or errors can spell human catastrophe. This book describes, from both practical and theoretical perspectives, an AI technology for supporting sound clinical decision making and safe patient management. The technology combines techniques from conventional software engineering with a systematic method for building intelligent agents. Although the focus is on medicine, many of the ideas can be applied to AI systems in other hazardous settings. The book also covers a number of general AI problems, including knowledge representation and expertise modeling, reasoning and decision making under uncertainty, planning and scheduling, and the design and implementation of intelligent agents.The book, written in an informal style, begins with the medical background and motivations, technical challenges, and proposed solutions. It then turns to a wide-ranging discussion of intelligent and autonomous agents, with particular reference to safety and hazard management. The final section provides a detailed discussion of the knowledge representation and other aspects of the agent model developed in the book, along with a formal logical semantics for the language.",,

One of the major questions emerging along with the propagation of AI in both technology and life is about safety in AI. This paper presents the author’s view about how formal methods can assist us in building safer and reliable AI.",,

But how secure are AI algorithms? In practical applications, learning algorithms refer to models of neural networks, which themselves are extremely complex. They are fed and trained with huge amounts of data. The number of necessary parameters explodes exponentially. Nobody knows exactly what happens in these “black boxes” in detail. A statistical trial-and-error procedure often remains. But how should questions of responsibility be decided in, e.g., autonomous driving or in medicine, if the methodological basics remain dark?",,
Controlling Safety of Artificial Intelligence-Based Systems in Healthcare,A safety controlling system could guide and control the implementation of artificial intelligence in healthcare.,Search,2021,6,"Mohammad Reza Davahli, Waldemar  Karwowski, Krzysztof  Fiok, Thomas T.

The main objective was to propose safety guidelines for implementing AI black-box models to reduce the risk of potential healthcare-related incidents and accidents. The system was developed by adopting the multi-attribute value model approach (MAVT), which comprises four symmetrical parts: extracting attributes, generating weights for the attributes, developing a rating scale, and finalizing the system. On the basis of the MAVT approach, three layers of attributes were created. The first level contained 6 key dimensions, the second level included 14 attributes, and the third level comprised 78 attributes. The key first level dimensions of the SCS included safety policies, incentives for clinicians, clinician and patient training, communication and interaction, planning of actions, and control of such actions. The proposed system may provide a basis for detecting AI utilization risks, preventing incidents from occurring, and developing emergency plans for AI-related risks. This approach could also guide and control the implementation of AI systems in the healthcare industry.",,
Understanding artificial intelligence ethics and safety,,Search,2019,37,David  Leslie,ArXiv,,10.5281/zenodo.3240529,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3240529,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/adeb97576107e9f8e1140302cf614d1da709d523,,"A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur.

This guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational awareness, and moral justifiability.",,
Safe Artificial General Intelligence via Distributed Ledger Technology,,Search,2019,7,Kristen W. Carlson,Big Data Cogn.

No proof exists that AGI will benefit humans and not harm or eliminate humans. A set of logically distinct conceptual components is proposed that are necessary and sufficient to (1) ensure various AGI scenarios will not harm humanity, and (2) robustly align AGI and human values and goals. By systematically addressing pathways to malevolent AI we can induce the methods/axioms required to redress them. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, “blockchain”) is integral to this proposal, e.g., “smart contracts” are necessary to address the evolution of AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention. The proposed axioms: (1) Access to technology by market license. (2) Transparent ethics embodied in DLT. (3) Morality encrypted via DLT. (4) Behavior control structure with values at roots. (5) Individual bar-code identification of critical components. (6) Configuration Item (from business continuity/disaster recovery planning). (7) Identity verification secured via DLT. (8) “Smart” automated contracts based on DLT. (9) Decentralized applications—AI software modules encrypted via DLT. (10) Audit trail of component usage stored via DLT. (11) Social ostracism (denial of resources) augmented by DLT petitions. (12) Game theory and mechanism design.",,

This paper proposes using elements of Hutter's agent-environment framework to define a decision support system for simulating, visualizing and analyzing AI designs to understand their consequences. The simulations do not have to be accurate predictions of the future; rather they show the futures that an agent design predicts will fulfill its motivations and that can be explored by AI designers to find risks to humans. In order to safely create a simulation model this paper shows that the most probable finite stochastic program to explain a finite history is finitely computable, and that there is an agent that makes such a computation without any unintended instrumental actions. It also discusses the risks of running an AI in a simulated environment.",,
A Framework for Safeguarding Artificial Intelligence Systems Within Healthcare Domain,,Search,2019,4,Avishek  Choudhury,British Journal of Healthcare Management,,10.12968/BJHC.2019.0066,https://doi.org/10.12968/BJHC.2019.0066,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/795bea6fb6a899805edf40140a8415fae5f68f7c,,"In healthcare, research on artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly dedicated to applying predictive analytic techniques to make clinical predictions. Even though artificial intelligence has shown promising results in cancer image recognition, triage service automation, and in disease prognosis, its clinical value has not been addressed. Currently, there is a lack of understanding around how some of these algorithms work. Despite knowing the potential risks associated with using artificial intelligence in healthcare, there is no clear framework to evaluate predictive algorithms, which are being commercially implemented within the healthcare industry. To ensure patient safety, regulatory authorities should ensure that proposed algorithms meet the accepted standards of clinical benefit, just as they do for therapeutics and predictive biomarkers. In this article, we offer a framework for the evaluation of predictive algorithms. Although not exhaustive, these criteria can enhance the quality of predictive algorithms and ensure that the algorithms effectively improve clinical outcomes.",,
Towards Safe Artificial General Intelligence,,Search,2018,21,Tom  Everitt,,,10.25911/5D134A2F8A7D3,https://doi.org/10.25911/5D134A2F8A7D3,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8b1e149ae23ea7839c9e3a2bd063c354ff7075d0,,"The field of artificial intelligence has recently experienced a number of breakthroughs thanks to progress in deep learning and reinforcement learning. Computer algorithms now outperform humans at Go, Jeopardy, image classification, and lip reading, and are becoming very competent at driving cars and interpreting natural language. The rapid development has led many to conjecture that artificial intelligence with greater-thanhuman ability on a wide range of tasks may not be far. This in turn raises concerns whether we know how to control such systems, in case we were to successfully build them. Indeed, if humanity would find itself in conflict with a system of much greater intelligence than itself, then human society would likely lose. One way to make sure we avoid such a conflict is to ensure that any future AI system with potentially greater-thanhuman-intelligence has goals that are aligned with the goals of the rest of humanity. For example, it should not wish to kill humans or steal their resources. The main focus of this thesis will therefore be goal alignment, i.e. how to design artificially intelligent agents with goals coinciding with the goals of their designers. Focus will mainly be directed towards variants of reinforcement learning, as reinforcement learning currently seems to be the most promising path towards powerful artificial intelligence. We identify and categorize goal misalignment problems in reinforcement learning agents as designed today, and give examples of how these agents may cause catastrophes in the future. We also suggest a number of reasonably modest modifications that can be used to avoid or mitigate each identified misalignment problem. Finally, we also study various choices of decision algorithms, and conditions for when a powerful reinforcement learning system will permit us to shut it down. The central conclusion is that while reinforcement learning systems as designed today are inherently unsafe to scale to human levels of intelligence, there are ways to potentially address many of these issues without straying too far from the currently so successful reinforcement learning paradigm. Much work remains in turning the high-level proposals suggested in this thesis into practical algorithms, however. Central claim: There are a number of theoretically valid, partial solutions to the problem of keeping artificial general intelligence both safe and useful.",,

Human factors research should accompany the development of AI from the outset.",,
