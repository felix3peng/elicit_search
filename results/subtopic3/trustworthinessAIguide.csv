An agile framework for trustworthy AI,The AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) ethics guidelines present a list of requirements that trustworthy AI systems should meet.,Search,2020,2,"Stefan  Leijnen, Huib  Aldewereld, Rudy van Belkom, Roland  Bijvank, Roelant  Ossewaarde",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880049a16c8fea47dcfe07450668f5507db5e96d,,"From the article: The ethics guidelines put forward by the AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) present a list of seven key requirements that Human-centered, trustworthy AI systems should meet. These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,

Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,A comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems is offered.,Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
Trustworthy AI Development Guidelines for Human System Interaction,AI development guidelines can improve the user trust in AI systems to enhance human-AI interactions.,Search,2020,3,"Chathurika S.

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,
The Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy AI – A Procrastination of Effective Law Enforcement,The Ethical Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence by the EU Commission are ineffective.,Search,2019,2,Ramak Molavi Vasse’i,Computer Law Review International,,10.9785/cri-2019-200502,https://doi.org/10.9785/cri-2019-200502,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/64223e4aa1a20a6406cd036417245385b6b33cc0,,"In the august issue of the CRi, Nathalie Smuha, the coordinator of the work of the High-Level Expert Group on AI, outlined the approach and considerations leading to the “The EU Approach to Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence”. This paper provides a critical assessment of the Ethical Guidelines of the EU Commission and points out why a law enforcement focused approach must be the essential next step towards a beneficial and humane development of AI. Questioning the diversity of the Commssion’s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, the dangers of ethics shopping are exposed as well as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights explored as already well established alternative reference framework for AI. Having exposed the need for effective red lines, not only the hidden social and ecological cost are assessed, but also the risk of “buying-out” research and other ethical issues neglected in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. Finally, three key weaknesses concerning the crucial translation of ethical principles into practice (enforcement) are highlighted.",,

To help mitigate possible risks and guide practitioners into a more responsible design, diverse organizations have released AI ethics frameworks. However, it remains unclear how ethical issues are dealt with in the everyday practices of AI developers. To this end, we have carried an exploratory empirical study interviewing AI developers working for Swedish public organizations to understand how ethics are enacted in practice. Our analysis found that several AI ethics issues are not consistently tackled, and AI systems are not fully recognized as part of a broader sociotechnical system.",,

At the same time, there is also awareness of potential risks and harm that may be caused by unregulated developments of artificial intelligence. Guiding principles are being developed around the world to foster trustworthy development and application of artificial intelligence systems. These guidelines can support developers and governing authorities when making decisions about the use of artificial intelligence. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission launched the report Ethical guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence in2019. The report aims to contribute to reflections and the discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies also beyond the countries of the European Union (EU). In this paper, we use the global health sector as a case and argue that the EU’s guidance leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally. We point to the urgency of shared globalized efforts to safeguard against the potential harms of artificial intelligence technologies in health care.",,

The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,

Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

Those outside of a given organization also need effective means of scrutinizing such claims. This report suggests various steps that different stakeholders can take to improve the verifiability of claims made about AI systems and their associated development processes, with a focus on providing evidence about the safety, security, fairness, and privacy protection of AI systems. We analyze ten mechanisms for this purpose--spanning institutions, software, and hardware--and make recommendations aimed at implementing, exploring, or improving those mechanisms.",,
