Universal Artificial Intelligence,Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems.,Search,2005,233,Dr. Marcus Hutter,Texts in Theoretical Computer Science An EATCS Series,,10.1007/b138233,https://doi.org/10.1007/b138233,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30a64bdf778b8f561af9ae589e822c2c800920b1,,"Foundational theories have contributed greatly to scientific progress in many fields. Examples include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in mathematics, and universal Turing machines in computer science. Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is an increasingly well-studied foundational theory for artificial intelligence, based on ancient principles in the philosophy of science and modern developments in information and probability theory. Importantly, it refrains from making unrealistic Markov, ergodicity, or stationarity assumptions on the environment. UAI provides a theoretically optimal agent AIXI and principled ideas for constructing practical autonomous agents. The theory also makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems. Such results may greatly enhance the trustability of autonomous agents, and guide design choices towards more robust agent architectures and incentive schemes. Finally, UAI offers a deeper appreciation of fundamental problems such as the induction problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma .",,
Analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence for intelligent machines,"A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution is required to implement anthropomorphic tasks on intelligent machines.",Search,1989,192,George N. Saridis,Autom.,,10.1016/0005-1098(89)90016-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(89)90016-2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e29ae4eb775af3886d5dae0090d099eabd28c33,,"Abstract Intelligent machines, like intelligent robots are capable of performing autonomously in uncertain environments, and have imposed new design requirements for modern engineers. New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,

The significantly updated second edition of Fundamentals of the New Artificial Intelligence thoroughly covers the most essential and widely employed material pertaining to neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy systems, rough sets, and chaos. In particular, this unique textbook explores the importance of this content for real-world applications. The exposition reveals the core principles, concepts, and technologies in a concise and accessible, easy-to-understand manner, and as a result, prerequisites are minimal: A basic understanding of computer programming and mathematics makes the book suitable for readers coming to this subject for the first time.

A Framework for Searching for General Artificial Intelligence,"A framework for searching for general artificial intelligence is needed to connect researchers, highlight open problems, and unify research efforts.",Search,2016,13,"Marek  Rosa, Jan  Feyereisl",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9dd15909f11aabfd2dc197cedc28920ddf477b2d,,"There is a significant lack of unified approaches to building generally intelligent machines. The majority of current artificial intelligence research operates within a very narrow field of focus, frequently without considering the importance of the 'big picture'. In this document, we seek to describe and unify principles that guide the basis of our development of general artificial intelligence. These principles revolve around the idea that intelligence is a tool for searching for general solutions to problems. We define intelligence as the ability to acquire skills that narrow this search, diversify it and help steer it to more promising areas. We also provide suggestions for studying, measuring, and testing the various skills and abilities that a human-level intelligent machine needs to acquire. The document aims to be both implementation agnostic, and to provide an analytic, systematic, and scalable way to generate hypotheses that we believe are needed to meet the necessary conditions in the search for general artificial intelligence. We believe that such a framework is an important stepping stone for bringing together definitions, highlighting open problems, connecting researchers willing to collaborate, and for unifying the arguably most significant search of this century.",,

In the course of the short history of AI, the hypothesis became more explicit. More recently Allen Newell (1980) discussed it as the physical symbol system hypothesis, widely accepted both in (classical, not connectionistic) AI and in cognitive science.The level of explanation chosen as the crucial one was the symbol level.",,

A practical example is described in some detail. The strengths and potential of parallel architectures and neural-net machines are briefly noted. >",,Review

Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, in which fuzzy sets (membership functions) and their logic operations are determined by a consistent algorithm according to the distributions of original data and the semantics of the fuzzy concepts, is applied to study some new techniques of feature selection, concept categorization and characteristic description; problems often encountered in artificial intelligence area such as machine learning and pattern recognition. These techniques developed under the framework of AFS theory in this paper are more simple and more interpretable than the conventional methods, since they imitate the human recognition process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection, the concept categorization and the characteristic description, these new techniques are applied to fuzzy clustering problems. Several benchmark data sets are used for this purpose. Clustering accuracies are comparable with or superior to the conventional algorithms such as FCM, k-means, and the new algorithm such as single point iterative weighted fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.",,
