Building on our previous work on AI Containment Problem we propose a number of guidelines which should help AI safety researchers to develop reliable sandboxing software for intelligent programs of all levels. Such safety container software will make it possible to study and analyze intelligent artificial agent while maintaining certain level of safety against information leakage, social engineering attacks and cyberattacks from within the container.",,
Safe and sound - artificial intelligence in hazardous applications,Computer science and artificial intelligence are increasingly used in the hazardous and uncertain realms of medical decision making.,Search,2000,272,"John  Fox, Subrata Kumar Das",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f62d215d4c40d299929d2e7fa105d54623a9e1bf,,"Computer science and artificial intelligence are increasingly used in the hazardous and uncertain realms of medical decision making, where small faults or errors can spell human catastrophe. This book describes, from both practical and theoretical perspectives, an AI technology for supporting sound clinical decision making and safe patient management. The technology combines techniques from conventional software engineering with a systematic method for building intelligent agents. Although the focus is on medicine, many of the ideas can be applied to AI systems in other hazardous settings. The book also covers a number of general AI problems, including knowledge representation and expertise modeling, reasoning and decision making under uncertainty, planning and scheduling, and the design and implementation of intelligent agents.The book, written in an informal style, begins with the medical background and motivations, technical challenges, and proposed solutions. It then turns to a wide-ranging discussion of intelligent and autonomous agents, with particular reference to safety and hazard management. The final section provides a detailed discussion of the knowledge representation and other aspects of the agent model developed in the book, along with a formal logical semantics for the language.",,
AI Safety Gridworlds,A2C and Rainbow do not solve safety problems satisfactorily.,Search,2017,141,"Jan  Leike, Miljan  Martic, Victoria  Krakovna, Pedro A.

These problems include safe interruptibility, avoiding side effects, absent supervisor, reward gaming, safe exploration, as well as robustness to self-modification, distributional shift, and adversaries. To measure compliance with the intended safe behavior, we equip each environment with a performance function that is hidden from the agent. This allows us to categorize AI safety problems into robustness and specification problems, depending on whether the performance function corresponds to the observed reward function. We evaluate A2C and Rainbow, two recent deep reinforcement learning agents, on our environments and show that they are not able to solve them satisfactorily.",,
Safe AI—is this possible?☆,"The inherently self-learning, self-adaptive nature of AI control systems makes them inherently unsafe.",Search,1995,11,M. G.

However, in the face of the inherently self-learning, self-adaptive nature of such techniques, it is pointed out that to produce safe, predictable systems, the controllers should be functionally deterministic!

Decision Support for Safe AI Design,There is considerable interest in ethical designs for artificial intelligence that do not pose risks to humans.,Search,2012,4,Bill  Hibbard,AGI,,10.1007/978-3-642-35506-6_13,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35506-6_13,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c40cad8cacaa47aac6d4cab8f80749beaebd690c,http://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_57.pdf,"There is considerable interest in ethical designs for artificial intelligence (AI) that do not pose risks to humans. This paper proposes using elements of Hutter's agent-environment framework to define a decision support system for simulating, visualizing and analyzing AI designs to understand their consequences. The simulations do not have to be accurate predictions of the future; rather they show the futures that an agent design predicts will fulfill its motivations and that can be explored by AI designers to find risks to humans. In order to safely create a simulation model this paper shows that the most probable finite stochastic program to explain a finite history is finitely computable, and that there is an agent that makes such a computation without any unintended instrumental actions. It also discusses the risks of running an AI in a simulated environment.",,

How Safe Is Artificial Intelligence?,Machine learning dramatically changes our civilization.,Search,2019,1,Klaus  Mainzer,Artificial intelligence - When do machines take over?,,10.1007/978-3-662-59717-0_11,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-59717-0_11,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5493c1017f9c42565e7f01a170e12a99d128ea82,,"Machine learning dramatically changes our civilization. We rely more and more on efficient algorithms, because otherwise the complexity of our civilizing infrastructure would not be manageable: Our brains are too slow and hopelessly overwhelmed by the amount of data we have to deal with. But how secure are AI algorithms? In practical applications, learning algorithms refer to models of neural networks, which themselves are extremely complex. They are fed and trained with huge amounts of data. The number of necessary parameters explodes exponentially. Nobody knows exactly what happens in these “black boxes” in detail. A statistical trial-and-error procedure often remains. But how should questions of responsibility be decided in, e.g., autonomous driving or in medicine, if the methodological basics remain dark?",,

In this paper, we present two new software libraries—hydra-zen and the rAI-toolbox—that address critical needs for responsible AI engineering. hydra-zen dramatically simplifies the process of making complex AI applications configurable, and their behaviors reproducible. The rAI-toolbox is designed to enable methods for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of AI-models in a way that is scalable and that composes naturally with other popular ML frameworks. We describe the design principles and methodologies that make these tools effective, including the use of property-based testing to bolster the reliability of the tools themselves. Finally, we demonstrate the composability and flexibility of the tools by showing how various use cases from adversarial robustness and explainable AI can be concisely implemented with familiar APIs.",,

The main objective was to propose safety guidelines for implementing AI black-box models to reduce the risk of potential healthcare-related incidents and accidents. The system was developed by adopting the multi-attribute value model approach (MAVT), which comprises four symmetrical parts: extracting attributes, generating weights for the attributes, developing a rating scale, and finalizing the system. On the basis of the MAVT approach, three layers of attributes were created. The first level contained 6 key dimensions, the second level included 14 attributes, and the third level comprised 78 attributes. The key first level dimensions of the SCS included safety policies, incentives for clinicians, clinician and patient training, communication and interaction, planning of actions, and control of such actions. The proposed system may provide a basis for detecting AI utilization risks, preventing incidents from occurring, and developing emergency plans for AI-related risks. This approach could also guide and control the implementation of AI systems in the healthcare industry.",,

Unforeseen effects of such massad-option has put the notion of AI safety into the public eye. AI safety is a relatively new field of research focused on techniques for building AI beneficial for humans. While there exist survey papers for the field of AI safety, there is a lack of a quantitative look at the research being conducted. The quantitative aspect gives a data-driven insight about the emerging trends, knowledge gaps and potential areas for future research. In this paper, bibliometric analysis of the literature finds significant increase in research activity since 2015. Also, the field is so new that most of the technical issues are open, including: explainability and its long-term utility, and value alignment which we have identified as the most important long-term research topic. Equally, there is a severe lack of research into concrete policies regarding AI. As we expect AI to be the one of the main driving forces of changes, AI safety is the field under which we need to decide the direction of humanity’s future.",,

No proof exists that AGI will benefit humans and not harm or eliminate humans. A set of logically distinct conceptual components is proposed that are necessary and sufficient to (1) ensure various AGI scenarios will not harm humanity, and (2) robustly align AGI and human values and goals. By systematically addressing pathways to malevolent AI we can induce the methods/axioms required to redress them. Distributed ledger technology (DLT, “blockchain”) is integral to this proposal, e.g., “smart contracts” are necessary to address the evolution of AI that will be too fast for human monitoring and intervention. The proposed axioms: (1) Access to technology by market license. (2) Transparent ethics embodied in DLT. (3) Morality encrypted via DLT. (4) Behavior control structure with values at roots. (5) Individual bar-code identification of critical components. (6) Configuration Item (from business continuity/disaster recovery planning). (7) Identity verification secured via DLT. (8) “Smart” automated contracts based on DLT. (9) Decentralized applications—AI software modules encrypted via DLT. (10) Audit trail of component usage stored via DLT.

This Blue Sky Ideas paper proposes a unifying set of declarative principles that enable a more uniform evaluation of arbitrary AI systems along multiple dimensions of the extent to which they are suitable for use by specific classes of human operators. It leverages recent AI research and the unique strengths of the field to develop human-centric principles for AI systems that address the concerns noted above.",,

This study examines the health hazards caused by these new forms of technological management. Occupational risks can be reduced if they are taken into account when programming an algorithm. This study confirms the need for algorithms to be correctly programmed, taking account of these occupational risks. In the same way as supervisors have to be trained in risk prevention to be able to perform their work, the algorithm must be programmed to weigh up the occupational risks – and when such features do not exist, steps must be taken to prevent the algorithm being used to direct workers. The algorithm must assess all (known) factors posing a risk to workers’ health and safety. It therefore seems necessary to incorporate a mandatory risk assessment performed by specialists in the programming of algorithms so that all ascertained risks can be taken into account.",,
