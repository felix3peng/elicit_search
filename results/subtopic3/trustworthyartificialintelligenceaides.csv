Such systems provide customers with timely, informed, and customized inferences to aid their decision, while at the same time utilizing appropriate security protection mechanisms for AI models. Additionally, such systems should also use Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to protect customers' data at any time.

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,
Zombies in the Loop? Humans Trust Untrustworthy AI-Advisors for Ethical Decisions,AI is overtrusted rather than distrusted.,Search,2021,,"Sebastian  Krugel, Andreas  Ostermaier, Matthias  Uhl",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5fa1ca52f54ec170d42f899ff918ec3609895d42,,"Departing from the claim that AI needs to be trustworthy, we find that ethical advice from an AI-powered algorithm is trusted even when its users know nothing about its training data and when they learn information about it that warrants distrust. We conducted online experiments where the subjects took the role of decision-makers who received advice from an algorithm on how to deal with an ethical dilemma. We manipulated the information about the algorithm and studied its influence. Our findings suggest that AI is overtrusted rather than distrusted. We suggest digital literacy as a potential remedy to ensure the responsible use of AI.",,
Transparency and trust in artificial intelligence systems,Transparency can have a negative impact on trust in machine learning-based decision support tools.,Search,2020,20,"Philipp  Schmidt, Felix  Bießmann, Timm  Teubner",J.

Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology.",,

Such data may support improving the quality of service, but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems.

As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Education: Pitfalls and Pathways,Artificial Intelligence Education (AIED) is a beneficial tool for education but poses ethical risks.,Search,2020,,Nathalie A.

This development was further spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, which rendered many educational institutions dependent on (AI-enabled) digital learning tools to continue their activities. While the use of AI systems can lead to numerous benefits, it can also entail ethical risks, which are increasingly appearing on legislators’ agendas. Many of these risks are context-specific and increase in significance when vulnerable individuals are involved, asymmetries of power exist, or human rights and democratic values are at stake more generally. Surprisingly, however, regulators have thus far paid only little attention to the specific risks arising in the context of Artificial Intelligence in education (AIED). This paper hence aims to assess the ethical challenges posed by AIED. Its normative framework consists of the seven requirements for Trustworthy AI, as set out in the Ethics Guidelines of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI. After an overview of the broader context in which these requirements took shape (Section 2), the paper examines each requirement in the educational realm, as well as the pitfalls that should be addressed to enable their realisation (Section 3). Particular attention is given to the special role of education in shaping people’s minds, and the manner in which this role can be used both to empower and exploit individuals. The paper notes that AIED’s main strengths – offering education on a wider scale, through more flexible and individualised learning methods, and through the closer monitoring of students’ reception of the materials – are also its main liabilities when left unchecked. Finally, the paper discusses various pathways that policymakers should consider to foster Trustworthy AIED beyond the adoption of guidelines (Section 4), before concluding (Section 5).",,Review
Trusting artificial intelligence in cybersecurity is a double-edged sword,Trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for cybersecurity is necessary.,Search,2019,28,"Mariarosaria  Taddeo, Tom  McCutcheon, Luciano  Floridi",Nat.

Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 billion net worth by 2025. The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabilities. At the same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks) to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applications themselves, which may pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that, to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for cybersecurity is necessary. To this end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.Current national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments mention explicitly the use of AI. However, it will be important to develop standards and certification procedures, which involves continuous monitoring and assessment of threats. The focus should be on the reliability of AI-based systems, rather than on eliciting users’ trust in AI.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence is used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, and several other things.",Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,
