"Better, Nicer, Clearer, Fairer: A Critical Assessment of the Movement for Ethical Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning","High-profile values statements endorsing ethical design for artificial intelligence and machine learning can lead to limited, technologically deterministic, expert-driven views of what ethical AI/ML means and how it might work.",Search,2019,111,"Daniel  Greene, Anna Lauren Hoffmann, Luke  Stark",HICSS,,10.24251/HICSS.2019.258,https://doi.org/10.24251/HICSS.2019.258,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e6bcf7d0e3798aebb7114cdc3d89a55a808b29de,http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/59651/1/0211.pdf,"This paper uses frame analysis to examine recent high-profile values statements endorsing ethical design for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML). Guided by insights from values in design and the sociology of business ethics, we uncover the grounding assumptions and terms of debate that make some conversations about ethical design possible while forestalling alternative visions. Vision statements for ethical AI/ML co-opt the language of some critics, folding them into a limited, technologically deterministic, expert-driven view of what ethical AI/ML means and how it might work.",,
Towards Establishing Criteria for the Ethical Analysis of Artificial Intelligence,The lack of morally relevant features calls for caution when considering the role of AI in some specific human activities.,Search,2020,4,"Michele  Farisco, Kathinka  Evers, Arleen  Salles",Sci.

In this article, we propose a methodological model for a comprehensive ethical analysis of some uses of AI, notably as a replacement of human actors in specific activities. We emphasize the need for conceptual clarification of relevant key terms (e.g., intelligence) in order to undertake such reflection. Against that background, we distinguish two levels of ethical analysis, one practical and one theoretical. Focusing on the state of AI at present, we suggest that regardless of the presence of intelligence, the lack of morally relevant features calls for caution when considering the role of AI in some specific human activities.",,
An artificial neural network approach for creating an ethical artificial agent,A developed artificial neutral network considers various effective factors for the ethical assessment of actions.,Search,2009,21,"Ali Reza Honarvar, Nasser  Ghasem-Aghaee",2009 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation - (CIRA),,10.1109/CIRA.2009.5423190,https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.2009.5423190,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ccbba7f671c53c907843bd5d806669dd53982c37,,"Autonomous robotic systems and intelligent artificial agents' capability have advanced dramatically. Since the intelligent artificial agents have been developing more autonomous and human-like, the capability of them to make moral decisions becomes an important issue.

Some challenges of machine ethics are much like many other challenges involved in designing machines. There is nearly universal agreement among modern AI professionals that artificial intelligence falls short of human capabilities in some critical sense, even though AI algorithms have beaten humans in many specific domains such as chess. In creating a superhuman chess player, the human programmers necessarily sacrificed their ability to predict Deep Blue's local, specific game behavior. A different set of ethical issues arises when one can contemplate the possibility that some future AI systems might be candidates for having moral status. One also has moral reasons to treat them in certain ways, and to refrain from treating them in certain other ways. Superintelligence may be achievable by increasing processing speed.",,

Ethical Artificial Intelligence - An Open Question,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an effective science which employs strong enough approaches, methods, and techniques to solve unsolvable real world based problems.",Search,2017,12,"Alice  Pavaloiu, Utku  Kose",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b952eaffb220ed192728d2ce7436235827132057,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an effective science which employs strong enough approaches, methods, and techniques to solve unsolvable real world based problems. Because of its unstoppable rise towards the future, there are also some discussions about its ethics and safety. Shaping an AI friendly environment for people and a people friendly environment for AI can be a possible answer for finding a shared context of values for both humans and robots. In this context, objective of this paper is to address the ethical issues of AI and explore the moral dilemmas that arise from ethical algorithms, from pre set or acquired values. In addition, the paper will also focus on the subject of AI safety. As general, the paper will briefly analyze the concerns and potential solutions to solving the ethical issues presented and increase readers awareness on AI safety as another related research interest.",,
Ethics in artificial intelligence: introduction to the special issue,"The development of intelligent systems must incorporate moral, ethical, and societal values.",Search,2018,129,Virginia  Dignum,Ethics and Information Technology,,10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-018-9450-z,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6b77b4235bd455cf6df68cfa4fe4e2aa9401d06c,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10676-018-9450-z.pdf,"Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have generated a steep interest from media and general public. As AI systems (e.g. robots, chatbots, avatars and other intelligent agents) are moving from being perceived as a tool to being perceived as autonomous agents and team-mates, an important focus of research and development is understanding the ethical impact of these systems. What does it mean for an AI system to make a decision? What are the moral, societal and legal consequences of their actions and decisions? Can an AI system be held accountable for its actions? How can these systems be controlled once their learning capabilities bring them into states that are possibly only remotely linked to their initial, designed, setup? Should such autonomous innovation in commercial systems even be allowed, and how should use and development be regulated? These and many other related questions are currently the focus of much attention. The way society and our systems will be able to deal with these questions will for a large part determine our level of trust, and ultimately, the impact of AI in society, and the existence of AI. Contrary to the frightening images of a dystopic future in media and popular fiction, where AI systems dominate the world and is mostly concerned with warfare, AI is already changing our daily lives mostly in ways that improve human health, safety, and productivity (Stone et al. 2016). This is the case in domain such as transportation; service robots; health-care; education; public safety and security; and entertainment. Nevertheless, and in order to ensure that those dystopic futures do not become reality, these systems must be introduced in ways that build trust and understanding, and respect human and civil rights. The need for ethical considerations in the development of intelligent interactive systems is becoming one of the main influential areas of research in the last few years, and has led to several initiatives both from researchers as from practitioners, including the IEEE initiative on Ethics of Autonomous Systems1, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics2, and the Partnership on AI3 amongst several others. As the capabilities for autonomous decision making grow, perhaps the most important issue to consider is the need to rethink responsibility (Dignum 2017). Whatever their level of autonomy and social awareness and their ability to learn, AI systems are artefacts, constructed by people to fulfil some goals. Theories, methods, algorithms are needed to integrate societal, legal and moral values into technological developments in AI, at all stages of development (analysis, design, construction, deployment and evaluation). These frameworks must deal both with the autonomic reasoning of the machine about such issues that we consider to have ethical impact, but most importantly, we need frameworks to guide design choices, to regulate the reaches of AI systems, to ensure proper data stewardship, and to help individuals determine their own involvement. Values are dependent on the socio-cultural context (Turiel 2002), and are often only implicit in deliberation processes, which means that methodologies are needed to elicit the values held by all the stakeholders, and to make these explicit can lead to better understanding and trust on artificial autonomous systems. That is, AI reasoning should be able to take into account societal values, moral and ethical considerations; weigh the respective priorities of values held by different stakeholders in various multicultural contexts; explain its reasoning; and guarantee transparency. Responsible Artificial Intelligence is about human responsibility for the development of intelligent systems along fundamental human principles and values, to ensure human flourishing and wellbeing in a sustainable world. In fact, Responsible AI is more than the ticking of some ethical ‘boxes’ in a report, or the development of some add-on features, or switch-off buttons in AI systems. Rather, responsibility is fundamental",,
Ethical Artificial Intelligence for Digital Health Organizations,A US-based Digital Health company developed an ethical code for emotional AI services.,Search,2020,9,"Angela  Joerin, Michiel  Rauws, Russell  Fulmer, Valerie  Black",Cureus,,10.7759/cureus.7202,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7202,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a8f262b28aa4a35196814b447346f99173c4795a,https://www.cureus.com/articles/25462-ethical-artificial-intelligence-for-digital-health-organizations.pdf,"This technical report describes the methods undertaken by a US-based Digital Health company (X2AI or X2 for short) to develop an ethical code for startup environments and other organizations delivering emotional artificial intelligence (AI) services, especially for mental health support. With a growing demand worldwide for scalable, affordable, and accessible health care solutions, the use of AI offers tremendous potential to improve emotional well-being. To realize this potential, it is imperative that AI service providers prioritize clear and consistent ethical guidelines that align with global considerations regarding user safety and privacy. This report offers a template for an ethical code that can be implemented by other emotional AI services and their affiliates. It includes practical guidelines for integrating support from clients, collaborators, and research partners. It also shows how existing ethical systems can inform the development of AI ethics.",,
Ethical Management of Artificial Intelligence,"The ethical management of AI involves managerial decision making, ethical considerations, and macro- and micro-environmental dimensions.",Search,2021,8,"Alfred Benedikt Brendel, Milad  Mirbabaie, Tim-Benjamin  Lembcke, Lennart  Hofeditz",,,10.3390/SU13041974,https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13041974,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3dfd53d9fe69f0e7ea66ee4357bb84a3951f6e32,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/4/1974/pdf?version=1613092527,"With artificial intelligence (AI) becoming increasingly capable of handling highly complex tasks, many AI-enabled products and services are granted a higher autonomy of decision-making, potentially exercising diverse influences on individuals and societies. While organizations and researchers have repeatedly shown the blessings of AI for humanity, serious AI-related abuses and incidents have raised pressing ethical concerns. Consequently, researchers from different disciplines widely acknowledge an ethical discourse on AI. However, managers—eager to spark ethical considerations throughout their organizations—receive limited support on how they may establish and manage AI ethics. Although research is concerned with technological-related ethics in organizations, research on the ethical management of AI is limited. Against this background, the goals of this article are to provide a starting point for research on AI-related ethical concerns and to highlight future research opportunities. We propose an ethical management of AI (EMMA) framework, focusing on three perspectives: managerial decision making, ethical considerations, and macro- as well as micro-environmental dimensions. With the EMMA framework, we provide researchers with a starting point to address the managing the ethical aspects of AI.",,

In this paper, we complement existing surveys, which largely focused on the psychological, social and legal discussions of the topic, with an analysis of recent advances in technical solutions for AI governance. By reviewing publications in leading AI conferences including AAAI, AAMAS, ECAI and IJCAI, we propose a taxonomy which divides the field into four areas: 1) exploring ethical dilemmas; 2) individual ethical decision frameworks; 3) collective ethical decision frameworks; and 4) ethics in human-AI interactions. We highlight the intuitions and key techniques used in each approach, and discuss promising future research directions towards successful integration of ethical AI systems into human societies.",,Review
Artificial Intelligence: the global landscape of ethics guidelines,A global convergence is emerging around five ethical principles with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted.,Search,2019,228,"Anna  Jobin, Marcello  Ienca, Effy  Vayena",ArXiv,,10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-019-0088-2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7bf47af1f989c1a999d7dab24d86d19f13e8ba55,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11668,"In the last five years, private companies, research institutions as well as public sector organisations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical AI, yet there is debate about both what constitutes ""ethical AI"" and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analyzed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted; why they are deemed important; what issue, domain or actors they pertain to; and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.",,

This article discusses AI in terms of the medical ethics issues involved, both existing and potential. Once artificial intelligence is fully developed within electronic systems, it will afford many useful applications in many sectors ranging from banking, agriculture, medical procedures to military operations, especially by decreasing the involvement of humans in critically dangerous activities. Robots as well as computers themselves are embodiments of values inasmuch as they entail actions and choices, but their practical applications are modelled or programmed by the engineers building the systems. AI will need algorithmic procedures to ensure safety in the implementation of such systems. The AI algorithms written could naturally contain errors that may result in unforeseen consequences and unfair outcomes along economic and racial class lines. It is crucial that measures be taken to monitor technological developments ensuring preventative and precautionary safeguards are in place to safeguard the rights of those involved against direct or indirect coercion. While it is the responsibility of AI researchers to ensure that the future impact is more positive than negative, ethicists and philosophers need to be deeply involved in the development of such technologies from the beginning.",,

The behavior of future AI systems can be described by mathematical equations, which are adapted to analyze possible unintended AI behaviors and ways that AI designs can avoid them. This article makes the case for utility-maximizing agents and for avoiding infinite sets in agent definitions. It shows how to avoid agent self-delusion using model-based utility functions and how to avoid agents that corrupt their reward generators (sometimes called ""perverse instantiation"") using utility functions that evaluate outcomes at one point in time from the perspective of humans at a different point in time. It argues that agents can avoid unintended instrumental actions (sometimes called ""basic AI drives"" or ""instrumental goals"") by accurately learning human values. This article defines a self-modeling agent framework and shows how it can avoid problems of resource limits, being predicted by other agents, and inconsistency between the agent's utility function and its definition (one version of this problem is sometimes called ""motivated value selection""). This article also discusses how future AI will differ from current AI, the politics of AI, and the ultimate use of AI to help understand the nature of the universe and our place in it.",,
Artificial intelligence: From ethics to policy,Logging procedures and decisions of an ethical nature is necessary for ethics to play a role in the use of artificial intelligence for the public good.,Search,2020,5,,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0f3978a906aa1164a3dd8de357f5b4d59fd80534,,"Based on a framing of 'AI as a social experiment,' this study arrives at regulatory options for public administrations and governmental organisations who are looking to deploy AI/ML solutions, as well as the private companies who are creating AI/ML solutions for use in the public arena. The reasons for targeting this application sector concern: the need for a high standard of transparency, respect for democratic values, and legitimacy. The policy options presented in the study demand targeted procedural solutions. Together, these chart a path towards accountability in AI; procedures and decisions of an ethical nature are systematically logged prior to the deployment of an AI system. This logging is the first step in allowing ethics to play a formidable role in the implementation of AI for the public good.",,
