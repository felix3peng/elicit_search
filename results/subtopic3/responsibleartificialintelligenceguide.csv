Although accuracy of AI models is undoubtedly the most important factor considered while deploying AI based products, there is urgent need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly. Responsible AI is a framework that each software developing organization needs to adapt to build customer trust in the transparency, accountability, fairness, and security of deployed AI solutions. At the same time a key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models. This tutorial will throw light on these aspects of Responsible AI with a working example demonstrating the concept. The intent of the tutorial will be to equip the audience with enough knowledge of the concepts along with code to gain appreciation for the importance of building Responsible AI.",,
Principles and business processes for responsible AI,A risk assessment approach is required to manage AI responsibly.,Search,2019,25,Roger  Clarke,Comput. Law Secur.

This second article discusses how an organisation can manage AI responsibly, in order to protect its own interests, but also those of its stakeholders and society as a whole. A limited amount of guidance is provided by ethical analysis. A much more effective approach is to apply adapted forms of the established techniques of risk assessment and risk management. Critically, risk assessment needs to be undertaken not only with the organisation's own interests in focus, but also from the perspectives of other stakeholders. To underpin this new form of business process, a set of Principles for Responsible AI is presented, consolidating proposals put forward by a diverse collection of 30 organisations.",,
Responsibility and Artificial Intelligence,"The main concern of Responsible AI is the identification of the relative responsibility of all actors involved in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems.",Search,2020,4,Virginia  Dignum,,,10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190067397.013.12,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190067397.013.12,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/faf748f8f38d48f2ef310e9e6f55ed277dcbebbf,,"This chapter explores the concept of responsibility in artificial intelligence (AI). Being fundamentally tools, AI systems are fully under the control and responsibility of their owners or users. However, their potential autonomy and capability to learn require that design considers accountability, responsibility, and transparency principles in an explicit and systematic manner. The main concern of Responsible AI is thus the identification of the relative responsibility of all actors involved in the design, development, deployment, and use of AI systems. Firstly, society must be prepared to take responsibility for AI impact. Secondly, Responsible AI implies the need for mechanisms that enable AI systems to act according to ethics and human values. Lastly, Responsible AI is about participation. It is necessary to understand how different people work with and live with AI technologies across cultures in order to develop frameworks for responsible AI.",,
Responsible AI and Its Stakeholders,All stakeholders involved in the development of AI are responsible for their systems.,Search,2020,3,"Gabriel  Lima, Meeyoung  Cha",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1d2eac19d1bd75d9d9f2afc919c2612b819c4ac2,,"Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) proposes a framework that holds all stakeholders involved in the development of AI to be responsible for their systems.

We discuss three notions of responsibility (i.e., blameworthiness, accountability, and liability) for all stakeholders, including AI, and suggest the roles of jurisdiction and the general public in this matter.",,
Towards Responsible Artificial Intelligence in Long-term Care: A Scoping Review on Practical Approaches.,There is limited empirical evidence detailing how responsible AI innovation is addressed in context.,Search,2021,,"Dirk R M Lukkien, Henk Herman Nap, Hendrik P Buimer, Alexander  Peine, Wouter P C Boon, Johannes C F Ket, Mirella M N Minkman, Ellen H M Moors",The Gerontologist,,10.1093/geront/gnab180,https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab180,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a2adc42d39d81e6cdb5b32c45451c42fd3aa3427,https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/geront/gnab180/42216937/gnab180.pdf,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely positioned to become a key element of intelligent technologies used in the long-term care (LTC) for older adults. The increasing relevance and adoption of AI has encouraged debate over the societal and ethical implications of introducing and scaling AI. This scoping review investigates how the design and implementation of AI technologies in LTC is addressed responsibly: so called responsible innovation (RI).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

We conducted a systematic literature search in five electronic databases using concepts related to LTC, AI and RI. We then performed a descriptive and thematic analysis to map the key concepts, types of evidence and gaps in the literature.

RESULTS

After reviewing 3,339 papers, 25 papers were identified that met our inclusion criteria. From this literature, we extracted three overarching themes: user-oriented AI innovation; framing AI as a solution to RI issues; and context-sensitivity. Our results provide an overview of measures taken and recommendations provided to address responsible AI innovation in LTC.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

The review underlines the importance of the context of use when addressing responsible AI innovation in LTC. However, limited empirical evidence actually details how responsible AI innovation is addressed in context. Therefore, we recommend expanding empirical studies on RI at the level of specific AI technologies and their local contexts of use. Also, we call for more specific frameworks for responsible AI innovation in LTC to flexibly guide researchers and innovators. Future frameworks should clearly distinguish between RI processes and outcomes.",,Review
Responsible AI: A Primer for the Legal Community,"The legal community should have a good understanding of the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence in order to inform, translate, and advise on the legal implications of AI systems.",Search,2020,,"Ilana  Golbin, Anand S.

Applications range from hiring and credit limit decisions, to loan and healthcare claim approvals, to criminal sentencing, and even the selective provision of information by social media companies to different groups of viewers. The increased adoption of AI, affecting so many aspects of our daily lives, highlights the potential risks around automated decision making and the need for better governance and ethical standards when deploying such systems. In response to that need, governments, states, municipalities, private sector organizations, and industry groups around the world have drafted hundreds, perhaps even thousands at this point - of new, regulatory proposals and guidelines; many already in effect and more on the way. The data-driven and often black box nature of these systems does not absolve organizations from the social responsibility or increasingly commonplace regulatory requirements to confirm they work as intended and are deployed in a responsible manner, lest they run the risk of reputational damage, regulatory fines, and/or legal action. The legal community should have a good understanding of the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence in order to inform, translate, and advise on the legal implications of AI systems.",,
Toward an Understanding of Responsible Artificial Intelligence Practices,There is an urgently need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly and act in a manner meeting stakeholders’ expectations and applicable regulations.,Search,2020,16,"Yichuan  Wang, Mengran  Xiong, Hossein  Olya",HICSS,,10.24251/hicss.2020.610,https://doi.org/10.24251/hicss.2020.610,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6f62e85aa4034e206caa2482e90c349c954e21fb,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/162719/8/Toward%20an%20Understanding%20of%20Responsible%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Practices.pdf,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is influencing all aspects of human and business activities nowadays. Although potential benefits emerged from AI technologies have been widely discussed in many current literature, there is an urgently need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly and act in a manner meeting stakeholders’ expectations and applicable regulations. We seek to fill the gap by exploring the practices of responsible AI and identifying the potential benefits when implementing responsible AI practices. In this study, 10 responsible AI cases were selected from different industries to better understand the use of responsible AI in practices. Four responsible AI practices are identified, including governance, ethically design solutions, risk control and training and education and five strategies for firms who are considering to adopt responsible AI practices are recommended.",,

Software Engineering for Responsible AI: An Empirical Study and Operationalised Patterns,An empirical study interviewed scientists and engineers on AI ethics principles and their implementation.,Search,2021,1,"Qinghua  Lu, Liming  Zhu, Xiwei  Xu, Jon  Whittle, David  Douglas, Conrad  Sanderson",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a03b02e61b447ce1456624853d7accfd24a2711,,"Although artificial intelligence (AI) is solving real-world challenges and transforming industries, there are serious concerns about its ability to behave and make decisions in a responsible way. Many AI ethics principles and guidelines for responsible AI have been recently issued by governments, organisations, and enterprises. However, these AI ethics principles and guidelines are typically high-level and do not provide concrete guidance on how to design and develop responsible AI systems. To address this shortcoming, we first present an empirical study where we interviewed 21 scientists and engineers to understand the practitioners’ perceptions on AI ethics principles and their implementation. We then propose a template that enables AI ethics principles to be operationalised in the form of concrete patterns and suggest a list of patterns using the newly created template. These patterns provide concrete, operationalised guidance that facilitate the development of responsible AI systems.",,
Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Value Formation and Market Performance in Healthcare: the Mediating Role of Patient’s Cognitive Engagement,Different facets of responsible AI guide healthcare firms in evidence-based medicine and improved patient-centered care.,Search,2021,11,"Pradeep  Kumar, Yogesh K.

Owing to the nature of the services and the vulnerability of a large section of end-users, the topic of responsible AI has become the subject of widespread study and discussion. We conduct a mixed-method study to identify the constituents of responsible AI in the healthcare sector and investigate its role in value formation and market performance. The study context is India, where AI technologies are in the developing phase. The results from 12 in-depth interviews enrich the more nuanced understanding of how different facets of responsible AI guide healthcare firms in evidence-based medicine and improved patient centered care. PLS-SEM analysis of 290 survey responses validates the theoretical framework and establishes responsible AI as a third-order factor. The 174 dyadic data findings also confirm the mediation mechanism of the patient’s cognitive engagement with responsible AI-solutions and perceived value, which leads to market performance.",,
Ensuring Responsible AI in Practice,Ethical reasoning by AI systems can be ensured by including human oversight and control.,Search,2019,,Virginia  Dignum,Responsible Artificial Intelligence,,10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6_6,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-30371-6_6,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dd9b74c42bd880f84b3b2a0a984fda481ec83d49,,"In the previous chapters, we have discussed the issue of responsibility with respect to the processes to design, develop, deploy and use AI (Chapter 4), and how to deal with ethical reasoning by the AI systems themselves (Chapter 5).

Understanding artificial intelligence ethics and safety,The UK public sector can counteract harmful AI effects by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation.,Search,2019,37,David  Leslie,ArXiv,,10.5281/zenodo.3240529,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3240529,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/adeb97576107e9f8e1140302cf614d1da709d523,,"A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever-expanding availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing platforms, and the advancement of increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms. Innovations in AI are already leaving a mark on government by improving the provision of essential social goods and services from healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and environmental management. These bounties are likely just the start. The prospect that progress in AI will help government to confront some of its most urgent challenges is exciting, but legitimate worries abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving technology, a steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made and that both unanticipated and harmful impacts will occur.

This guide, written for department and delivery leads in the UK public sector and adopted by the British Government in its publication, 'Using AI in the Public Sector,' identifies the potential harms caused by AI systems and proposes concrete, operationalisable measures to counteract them. It stresses that public sector organisations can anticipate and prevent these potential harms by stewarding a culture of responsible innovation and by putting in place governance processes that support the design and implementation of ethical, fair, and safe AI systems. It also highlights the need for algorithmically supported outcomes to be interpretable by their users and made understandable to decision subjects in clear, non-technical, and accessible ways. Finally, it builds out a vision of human-centred and context-sensitive implementation that gives a central role to communication, evidence-based reasoning, situational awareness, and moral justifiability.",,

In this talk, I will discuss the sociotechnical nature of several inherent and unavoidable AI failures and why it is important for the industry to systematically and proactively identify, assess, and mitigate harms caused by such failures in our AI-based products and services. I will then present Microsoft's recently released Guidelines for Human-AI Interaction and how we've been using them at Microsoft to help teams think through and prepare for different types of AI failures.",,
Responsible AI Challenges in End-to-end Machine Learning,"Fairness, accuracy, and robustness are critical AI requirements that must be easy to deploy and actionable.",Search,2021,,"Steven Euijong Whang, Ki Hyun Tae, Yuji  Roh, Geon  Heo",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0233cd95dd0bc327dd72a14d60216c98021250ab,,"Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision – depth, breadth, and usability – to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.",,

However, the appearance of research centres, projects or institutions addressing AI solutions from a multidisciplinary and multi-stakeholder perspective suggests a new approach to assessment comprising ethical guidelines, reports or tools and frameworks to help both academia and business to move towards a responsible conceptualisation of AI. They all highlight the relevance of three key aspects: (i) enhancing cooperation among the different stakeholders involved in the design, deployment and use of AI; (ii) promoting multidisciplinary dialogue, including different domains of expertise in this process; and (iii) fostering public engagement to maximise a trusted relation with new technologies and practitioners. In this paper, we introduce the Observatory on Society and Artificial Intelligence (OSAI), an initiative grew out of the project AI4EU aimed at stimulating reflection on a broad spectrum of issues of AI (ethical, legal, social, economic and cultural). In particular, we describe our work in progress around OSAI and suggest how this and similar initiatives can promote a wider appraisal of progress in AI. This will give us the opportunity to present our vision and our modus operandi to enhance the implementation of these three fundamental dimensions.",,
