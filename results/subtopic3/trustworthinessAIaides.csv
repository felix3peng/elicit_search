Such systems provide customers with timely, informed, and customized inferences to aid their decision, while at the same time utilizing appropriate security protection mechanisms for AI models. Additionally, such systems should also use Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to protect customers' data at any time.

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,
Questioning the Role of Moral AI as an Adviser within the Framework of Trustworthiness Ethics,One can argue for AI’s reliability based on the reasons for AI’s trustworthiness ethics.,Search,2021,,Silviya  Serafimova,Filosofiya-Philosophy,,10.53656/phil2021-04-07,https://doi.org/10.53656/phil2021-04-07,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/da0d6f6c6646773ec04772dad977f2e6f1e20155,,"The main objective of this article is to demonstrate why despite the growing interest in justifying AI’s trustworthiness, one can argue for AI’s reliability.

Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,"AI practitioners need to develop trustworthy AI systems that are robust, generalizable, explainable, transparent, reproducible, fair, private, and aligned with human values.",Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

Such data may support improving the quality of service, but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can benefit from these methods.",,
Trustworthy AI,The issue of bias and fairness is one of the critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems.,Search,2021,,"Richa  Singh, Mayank  Vatsa, Nalini  Ratha",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f52a1c995d5b7ba2be6d419146dbf9ee6b0316c,,"Modern AI systems are reaping the advantage of novel learning methods. With their increasing usage, we are realizing the limitations and shortfalls of these systems. Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

In this paper, we propose a supplier's declaration of conformity (SDoC) for AI services to help increase trust in AI services. An SDoC is a transparent, standardized, but often not legally required, document used in many industries and sectors to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. We envision an SDoC for AI services to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed and voluntarily released by AI service providers for examination by consumers. Importantly, it conveys product-level rather than component-level functional testing. We suggest a set of declaration items tailored to AI and provide examples for two fictitious AI services.",,

Instead of replacing humans, AI Augmentation uses AI to improve and support human operations, creating an environment where humans work side by side with AI systems. In this paper, we discuss how AI Augmentation can provide a path for building Trustworthy AI. We exemplify this approach using Robot Teleoperation. We lay out design guidelines and motivations for the development of AI Augmentation for Robot Teleoperation.

As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

This transparency requirement covers a number of questions that trustworthy AI services must answer, such as about their purposes. The participants also asked about the data used in AI services and from what sources the data were collected. They pointed out that AI must provide easy-to-understand explanations.

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), education faces two challenges: reaping the benefits of AI to improve education processes, both in the classroom and at the system level; and preparing students for new skillsets for increasingly automated economies and societies. AI applications are often still nascent, but there are many examples of promising uses that foreshadow how AI might transform education. With regard to the classroom, this paper highlights how AI can accelerate personalised learning, the support of students with special needs. At the system level, promising uses include predictive analysis to reduce dropout, and assessing new skillsets. A new demand for complex skills that are less easy to automate (e.g. higher cognitive skills like creativity and critical thinking) is also the consequence of AI and digitalisation. Reaching the full potential of AI requires that stakeholders trust not only the technology, but also its use by humans. This raises new policy challenges around “trustworthy AI”, encompassing the privacy and security of data, but also possible wrongful uses of data leading to biases against individuals or groups.",,
