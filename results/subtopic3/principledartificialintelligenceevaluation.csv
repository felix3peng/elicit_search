Artificial Intelligence in Learning Skills Assessment: A Pedagogical Innovation,The intelligent system used detects the level of the class in the different skills and offers educational situations to remedy shortcomings that are encountered.,Search,2020,2,"Okacha  Diyer, Naceur  Achtaich, Khalid  Najib",NISS,,10.1145/3386723.3387901,https://doi.org/10.1145/3386723.3387901,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e314a810fd70edb39997d0b773e6203ca4471a99,,"Competency-based learning assessment has recently undergone an important development in the field of education. Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student. In fact, it allows a judicious evaluation which follows the enormous progress by adopting an automated method which takes into account the competence level of each pupil.",,

An Integrative Framework for Artificial Intelligence Education,Modern introductory courses on AI do not train students to create intelligent systems or provide broad coverage of the field.,Search,2019,8,Pat  Langley,AAAI,,10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019670,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019670,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8650302e526be08ccb064ded25d9e7a4f5d1f04a,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/5032/4905,"Modern introductory courses on AI do not train students to create intelligent systems or provide broad coverage of this complex field. In this paper, we identify problems with common approaches to teaching artificial intelligence and suggest alternative principles that courses should adopt instead. We illustrate these principles in a proposed course that teaches students not only about component methods, such as pattern matching and decision making, but also about their combination into higher-level abilities for reasoning, sequential control, plan generation, and integrated intelligent agents. We also present a curriculum that instantiates this organization, including sample programming exercises and a project that requires system integration. Participants also gain experience building knowledge-based agents that use their software to produce intelligent behavior.",,

An integrated architecture for intelligence evaluation of automated vehicles.,A proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles.,Search,2020,3,"Heye  Huang, Xunjia  Zheng, Yibin  Yang, Jinxin  Liu, Wenjun  Liu, Jianqiang  Wang",Accident; analysis and prevention,,10.1016/j.aap.2020.105681,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2020.105681,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ede68d72439db3b2af8ecbad10e0a3d208fc6550,,"Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios.",,

Artificial intelligence methods are invoked to produce item-level partial-credit scores and diagnostic analyses similar to those of a human expert. Finally, cognitively-grounded measurement models provide diagnostic statements based on commonalities in performance across items. Progress toward achieving this conception is examined, with emphasis on two automated scoring programs. Potential applications of intelligent assessment are discussed.",,
An architecture for the evaluation of intelligent systems,The interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are useful to measure agents' intelligence.,Search,2011,,"Javier  Insa-Cabrera, José  Hernández-Orallo",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fa0f9f8f624bf431b5c1e67af310211b31813c5d,,"One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way. The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the execution of several environments, including those which are generated randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests, the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated environment will serve that purpose.",,

Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, in which fuzzy sets (membership functions) and their logic operations are determined by a consistent algorithm according to the distributions of original data and the semantics of the fuzzy concepts, is applied to study some new techniques of feature selection, concept categorization and characteristic description; problems often encountered in artificial intelligence area such as machine learning and pattern recognition. These techniques developed under the framework of AFS theory in this paper are more simple and more interpretable than the conventional methods, since they imitate the human recognition process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection, the concept categorization and the characteristic description, these new techniques are applied to fuzzy clustering problems. Several benchmark data sets are used for this purpose. Clustering accuracies are comparable with or superior to the conventional algorithms such as FCM, k-means, and the new algorithm such as single point iterative weighted fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.",,

These systems are used to screen loan applicants, make sentencing recommendations for criminal defendants, scan social media posts for disallowed content and more. Because these systems don’t assign meaning to their complex learned correlation network, they can learn associations that don’t equate to causality, resulting in non-optimal and indefensible decisions being made. In addition to making decisions that are sub-optimal, these systems may create legal liability for their designers and operators by learning correlations that violate anti-discrimination and other laws regarding what factors can be used in different types of decision making. This paper presents the use of a machine learning expert system, which is developed with meaning-assigned nodes (facts) and correlations (rules). Multiple potential implementations are considered and evaluated under different conditions, including different network error and augmentation levels and different training levels. The performance of these systems is compared to random and fully connected networks.",,
