Universal Artificial Intelligence,Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems.,Search,2005,233,Dr. Marcus Hutter,Texts in Theoretical Computer Science An EATCS Series,,10.1007/b138233,https://doi.org/10.1007/b138233,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30a64bdf778b8f561af9ae589e822c2c800920b1,,"Foundational theories have contributed greatly to scientific progress in many fields. Examples include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in mathematics, and universal Turing machines in computer science. Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is an increasingly well-studied foundational theory for artificial intelligence, based on ancient principles in the philosophy of science and modern developments in information and probability theory. Importantly, it refrains from making unrealistic Markov, ergodicity, or stationarity assumptions on the environment. UAI provides a theoretically optimal agent AIXI and principled ideas for constructing practical autonomous agents. The theory also makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems. Such results may greatly enhance the trustability of autonomous agents, and guide design choices towards more robust agent architectures and incentive schemes. Finally, UAI offers a deeper appreciation of fundamental problems such as the induction problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma .",,

Virtually all the literature on artificial intelligence is expressed in the jargon of commuter science, crowded with complex matrix algebra and differential equations. Unlike many other books on computer intelligence, this one demonstrates that most ideas behind intelligent systems are simple and straightforward. The book has evolved from lectures given to students with little knowledge of calculus, and the reader needs no prerequisites associated with knowledge of any programming language. The methods used in the book have been extensively tested through several courses given by the author.

The book provides an introduction to the field of computer intelligence, covering

rule-based expert systems,

fuzzy expert systems,

frame-based expert systems,

artificail neural networks,

evolutionary computation,

hybrid intelligent systems,

knowledge engineering,

data mining.

In a university setting the book can be used as an introductory course within computer science, information systems or engineering departments. The book is also suitable as a self-study guide for non-computer science professionals, giving access to the state of the art in knowledge-based systems and computational intelligence. Everyone who faces challenging problems and cannot solve them using traditional approaches can benefit",,

Fundamentals of artificial intelligence - an advanced course,The first part of the book by Delgrande and Mylopoulos discusses the concept of knowledge and its representation.,Search,1987,12,Wolfgang  Bibel,Springer study edition,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/63275acd4b6025e1b7ae790380f13891b8c57edb,,"This volume contains the elaborated and harmonized versions of seven lectures given at the first Advanced Course in Artificial Intelligence, held in Vignieu, France, in July 1985. Most of them were written in tutorial form; the book thus provides an extremely valuable guide to the fundamental aspects of AI. In the first part, Delgrande and Mylopoulos discuss the concept of knowledge and its representation. The second part is devoted to the processing of knowledge. The contribution by Huet shows that both computation and inference or deduction are just different aspects of the same phenomenon. The chapter written by Stickel gives a thorough and knowledgeable introduction to the most important aspects of deduction by some form of resolution. The kind of reasoning that is involved in inductive inference problem solving (or programming) from examples, and in learning, is covered by Biermann. The tutorial by Bibel covers the more important forms of knowledge processing that might play a significant role in common sense reasoning. The third part of the book focuses on logic programming and functional programming. Jorrand presents the language FP2, where term rewriting forms the basis for the semantics of both functional and parallel programming. In the last chapter, Shapiro gives an overview of the current state of concurrent PROLOG.",,Review
Analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence for intelligent machines,"A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution is necessary to implement hierarchically intelligent control on an intelligent machine.",Search,1989,192,George N.

New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined as a subfield of computer science which deals with machines and software that appear to think and solve problems. The overall goal of much of the work in artificial intelligence is to develop systems that perform like human beings. Whether or not these systems are really ‘intelligent’ is a philosophical question. For our purposes, the fact that these systems mimic human intelligence to some extent at least is sufficient. AI programs are programs that exhibit behavior normally identified with human intelligence, and until recently, not with computers. In particular, AI programs seem to grasp ideas and concepts. For example, some can understand natural languages, some can see or perform difficult assembly tasks, and others can infer new information from facts provided to the system. However, software that makes computers seem intelligent is not that different from any other kind of software.",,
