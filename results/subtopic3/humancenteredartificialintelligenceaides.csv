Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them. We further argue that issues of social responsibility such as fairness, accountability, interpretability, and transparency.",,

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) signifies a specific strategy meant to design smart systems whereby these systems can adapt to specific behaviors with respect to data. In the modern age, humans are rapidly collaborating with ML and AI systems. The AI that is human-based is a perspective of ML and AI, which algorithms have to be established with the awareness that they are a major segment of the massive system incorporating human.

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,
An analysis of expertise in intelligence analysis to support the design of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence,Intelligence analysis involves unpredictable processes and decision making about complex domains where analysts rely upon expertise.,Search,2021,,"Sam  Hepenstal, Leishi  Zhang, B.

However, systems must also be cognisant about how expertise is gained and designed so that this is not impinged. In this paper, we describe the results of Cognitive Task Analysis interviews with 6 experienced intelligence analysts. We capture themes, in terms of their decision making paths during an analysis task, and highlight how each theme is both influenced by expertise and an influence upon expertise. We also identify important interdependencies between themes. We propose that our findings can be used to help design Human-Centered AI (HCAI) systems for supporting intelligence analysts.",,

The system draws on a diverse set of AI technologies that are linked within a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent system. Although the system provides a number of automated functions, the overall framework is highly user centric in its support for human needs, responsiveness to human inputs, and adaptivity to user working style and preferences.",,

Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for ""Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.",,

Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants (AIA),"Artificial Intelligence-based Assistants (AIs) can unlock business value through automating processes, intensifying customer interaction, reducing errors, and speeding up interactions.",Search,2020,,Rainer  Schmidt,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2cebcd4441dad9aa56d95a507e9e2ee9ff8567c9,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received much attention due to the recent progress in several technological areas such as image detection, translation, and decision support [1]. Established businesses and many start-up businesses are eagerly discussing how they can gain a competitive advantage from complementing their products, services and processes with AI. In fact, based on the research in the AI domain since several decades, a broad variety of promising application fields were suggested where AI might add business value. Meanwhile, applications are not limited to simple structured problems, but even applications higher complexities are feasible, which require higher levels of “intelligence”. To avoid discussions on the ambivalent notion of “intelligence”, it shall refer to tasks involving perception, processing, action and learning [2]. Many applications are possible along these activities, in particular a user’s interaction via natural language. AI-based assistants employ technologies such as natural language processing, predictive analytics, machine learning, as well as voice recognition and generation. They unlock business value through automating processes, intensifying customer interaction, reducing errors, and speeding up interactions to name a few [3]. In general, two main impacts may be observed [4]. First, virtual personal assistants and chatbots, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home, enable the interaction of human beings with machines by voice, replacing standard human-computer interaction via mouse, keyboard, and screen of an application. Second, AIbased assistants replace human beings interfacing two application systems. These kinds of AI-based assistants are also subsumed under the term Robotic Process Automation (RPA) [5], handling interactions previously performed by humans to pair two application systems. The success of AI-based assistants may be described with the various offerings from the big tech providers (e.g. Alexa, Cortana, Siri) as well as numerous chatbots that created with the open-source development kits. For example, the Alexa universe already comprises 47’000 applications, which are referred to as “skills” [6]. This is also linked to a growth of application fields and interaction modes, which explains why assistant platforms are also recognized as generalpurpose technologies [7]. Following the understanding that information systems are socio-technical in nature, AI-based assistants should be framed as a step toward humanizing technology and work environments in the digital economy. This opens the stage for many research questions that shall be addressed in the mini track.",,

The IA includes specialist assistants for e-mail prioritization and telephone call filtering (communication management), Web search and Yellow Pages® lookup (information management), and calendar scheduling (time management). Each such assistant is designed to have a model of the user and a learning module for acquiring user preferences. In addition, the IA includes a toolbar providing a graphical interface to the system, a multimodal interface for accepting spoken commands and tracking the user’s activity, and a co-ordinator responsible for managing communication from the system to the user and for initiating system activities on the user’s behalf. A primary design objective of the IA is that its operation is as transparent as possible, to enable the user to control the system as far as is practicable without incurring a heavy overhead when creating and modifying the system’s behaviour. Hence each specialist assistant is designed to represent its user model in a way that is intuitively understandable to non-technical users, and is configured to adaptively modify its user model through time to accommodate the user’s changing preferences. However, in contrast to adaptive interface agents built under the behaviour-based paradigm, the assistants in the IA embrace complex AI representations and machine learning techniques to accomplish more sophisticated behaviour.",,Review
