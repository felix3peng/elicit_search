Examples include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in mathematics, and universal Turing machines in computer science. Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is an increasingly well-studied foundational theory for artificial intelligence, based on ancient principles in the philosophy of science and modern developments in information and probability theory. Importantly, it refrains from making unrealistic Markov, ergodicity, or stationarity assumptions on the environment. UAI provides a theoretically optimal agent AIXI and principled ideas for constructing practical autonomous agents. The theory also makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems. Such results may greatly enhance the trustability of autonomous agents, and guide design choices towards more robust agent architectures and incentive schemes. Finally, UAI offers a deeper appreciation of fundamental problems such as the induction problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma .",,

Analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence for intelligent machines,"A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution is required to implement anthropomorphic tasks on intelligent machines.",Search,1989,192,George N.

New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,
Introduction: Tools and Techniques of Artificial Intelligence,Several papers apply AI techniques to problems not thought of as AI problems at first glance.,Search,2003,2,"Ingrid  Russell, Susan M.

Of the 125 papers published in 2001 and 104 papers in 2002, twenty contributors were invited to submit expanded versions of their work. Of these, ten were selected for this special issue of IJPRAI. Several papers present a novel application of an AI technique to a problem typically considered to be in the AI domain. For example, natural language resources are used to improve information retrieval, user modeling techniques are used to develop strategies for game playing, and agent oriented methodologies are used in robotics. In contrast, some papers apply AI techniques to problems not thought of as AI problems at first glance: machine learning is used in bioinformatics and decision support techniques are applied to water resource management. Finally, some of the papers present extensions and improvements to AI methodologies: representing constraint satisfaction problems and combining supervised and unsupervised learning in a single mechanism. An important constraint in information retrieval is time — answers must be returned in time. Several researchers have considered using WordNet, a natural language resource, to improve the quality of information retrieval. However, the fine granularity of word sense representation in WordNet makes it difficult to apply to the problem of information retrieval to get results in time. In the first paper, Mihalcea proposes a solution to this problem, a set of methods that automatically transforms WordNet into a coarse grained dictionary appropriate for information retrieval.",,

Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, in which fuzzy sets (membership functions) and their logic operations are determined by a consistent algorithm according to the distributions of original data and the semantics of the fuzzy concepts, is applied to study some new techniques of feature selection, concept categorization and characteristic description; problems often encountered in artificial intelligence area such as machine learning and pattern recognition. These techniques developed under the framework of AFS theory in this paper are more simple and more interpretable than the conventional methods, since they imitate the human recognition process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection, the concept categorization and the characteristic description, these new techniques are applied to fuzzy clustering problems. Several benchmark data sets are used for this purpose. Clustering accuracies are comparable with or superior to the conventional algorithms such as FCM, k-means, and the new algorithm such as single point iterative weighted fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.",,
