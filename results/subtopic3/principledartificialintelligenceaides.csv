Universal Artificial Intelligence,Foundational theories have contributed greatly to scientific progress in many fields.,Search,2005,233,Dr. Marcus Hutter,Texts in Theoretical Computer Science An EATCS Series,,10.1007/b138233,https://doi.org/10.1007/b138233,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30a64bdf778b8f561af9ae589e822c2c800920b1,,"Foundational theories have contributed greatly to scientific progress in many fields. Examples include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in mathematics, and universal Turing machines in computer science. Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is an increasingly well-studied foundational theory for artificial intelligence, based on ancient principles in the philosophy of science and modern developments in information and probability theory. Importantly, it refrains from making unrealistic Markov, ergodicity, or stationarity assumptions on the environment. UAI provides a theoretically optimal agent AIXI and principled ideas for constructing practical autonomous agents. The theory also makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems. Such results may greatly enhance the trustability of autonomous agents, and guide design choices towards more robust agent architectures and incentive schemes. Finally, UAI offers a deeper appreciation of fundamental problems such as the induction problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma .",,
Artificial intelligence technologies for personnel learning management systems,Artificial intelligence technologies can be used to make intelligent agents on IBM Watson for use in learning management systems.,Search,2016,19,"Nayden  Nenkov, George  Dimitrov, Yuriy  Dyachenko, Katerina  Koeva",2016 IEEE 8th International Conference on Intelligent Systems (IS),,10.1109/IS.2016.7737420,https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2016.7737420,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/13386697b4358a0e0bdad1e089728116de2d48d1,,An essential part of modern education is computing. Learning management systems are introduced as an intermediary between a student and a teacher. This paradigm is shifted through reproduction of teacher's and student's intelligent procedures by intelligent agents. The Artificial Intelligence technologies are based on reproduction of principles of human intelligence. Functioning of general Artificial Intelligence is based on principle of double contingency and is impossible without the acquisition of elements of self-consciousness and self-cultivation that can be embodied in Artificial Neural Network. On its basis it is proposed to make intelligent agents on platform IBM Bluemix with IBM Watson technology. These agents in the form of chatbots have to automate the interaction between the student and the teacher within the frames of Moodle learning management system.,,
An Integrative Framework for Artificial Intelligence Education,Modern introductory courses on AI do not train students to create intelligent systems or provide broad coverage of this field.,Search,2019,8,Pat  Langley,AAAI,,10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019670,https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33019670,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8650302e526be08ccb064ded25d9e7a4f5d1f04a,https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/download/5032/4905,"Modern introductory courses on AI do not train students to create intelligent systems or provide broad coverage of this complex field. In this paper, we identify problems with common approaches to teaching artificial intelligence and suggest alternative principles that courses should adopt instead. We illustrate these principles in a proposed course that teaches students not only about component methods, such as pattern matching and decision making, but also about their combination into higher-level abilities for reasoning, sequential control, plan generation, and integrated intelligent agents. We also present a curriculum that instantiates this organization, including sample programming exercises and a project that requires system integration. Participants also gain experience building knowledge-based agents that use their software to produce intelligent behavior.",,
The use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in Computer-Assisted Instruction: an overview,One of the major goals of research in Artificial Intelligence is the representation of knowledge so that a computer can solve problems or communicate in a manner which exhibits “common sense”.,Search,1980,26,"Alice  Gable, Carl V.

Few programs for computers, including those for education, possess behavior which approaches any facet of the constellation of human skills and knowledge which are imprecisely called “common sense”. However, the revolutionary decline in hardware costs now makes it possible to consider economically viable, sophisticated designs for computer-aided instruction systems possessing some of the common sense attributes of a human tutor. In this survey we examine, in depth, techniques from Artificial Intelligence that can be used to endow a Computer-Aided Instruction system with approximations to some of the desirable qualities of a human tutor. We consider both techniques which have been proved in prototype systems for Computer-Aided Instruction and some techniques which were originally developed for other purposes.",,Review
Analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence for intelligent machines,"A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution is required to implement anthropomorphic tasks on intelligent machines.",Search,1989,192,George N. Saridis,Autom.,,10.1016/0005-1098(89)90016-2,https://doi.org/10.1016/0005-1098(89)90016-2,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e29ae4eb775af3886d5dae0090d099eabd28c33,,"Abstract Intelligent machines, like intelligent robots are capable of performing autonomously in uncertain environments, and have imposed new design requirements for modern engineers. New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,
The Intelligent Assistant: An Overview,The Intelligent Assistant (IA) uses complex AI representations and machine learning techniques to accomplish sophisticated behavior.,Search,2000,19,"Ben  Azvine, David  Djian, Kwok Ching Tsui, Wayne  Wobcke",Intelligent Systems and Soft Computing,,10.1007/10720181_9,https://doi.org/10.1007/10720181_9,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/567629648cfb530beae944308ef01af0db6afb44,,"The Intelligent Assistant (IA) is an integrated system of intelligent software agents that helps the user with communication, information and time management. The IA includes specialist assistants for e-mail prioritization and telephone call filtering (communication management), Web search and Yellow Pages® lookup (information management), and calendar scheduling (time management). Each such assistant is designed to have a model of the user and a learning module for acquiring user preferences. In addition, the IA includes a toolbar providing a graphical interface to the system, a multimodal interface for accepting spoken commands and tracking the user’s activity, and a co-ordinator responsible for managing communication from the system to the user and for initiating system activities on the user’s behalf. A primary design objective of the IA is that its operation is as transparent as possible, to enable the user to control the system as far as is practicable without incurring a heavy overhead when creating and modifying the system’s behaviour. Hence each specialist assistant is designed to represent its user model in a way that is intuitively understandable to non-technical users, and is configured to adaptively modify its user model through time to accommodate the user’s changing preferences. However, in contrast to adaptive interface agents built under the behaviour-based paradigm, the assistants in the IA embrace complex AI representations and machine learning techniques to accomplish more sophisticated behaviour.",,Review

The two branches of AI which empowers it to understand and interact with humans are Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Together, these three forms the bases of Artificial Learning Companion-which can be described as a system which can be used to aid the Learning process of the humans. While ML allows the computer program to learn on its own with minimal human intervention, NLP empowers the system to understand the user’s natural communication language through pre-coded programs. When these two aspects of Human Computer Interaction are combined, it enables the AI to take intelligent decisions with sufficient, relevant information. These decisions made by the system can be conveyed to the user using a static GUI, a voice assistant or a chatbot. In this paper, we have chosen to go with a chatbot because it is easy to use and is more relevant to the real-world implementation. The probability for each word is calculated and it provides P (A very close game | Sports) has obtained the highest probability",,

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined as a subfield of computer science which deals with machines and software that appear to think and solve problems. The overall goal of much of the work in artificial intelligence is to develop systems that perform like human beings. Whether or not these systems are really ‘intelligent’ is a philosophical question. For our purposes, the fact that these systems mimic human intelligence to some extent at least is sufficient. AI programs are programs that exhibit behavior normally identified with human intelligence, and until recently, not with computers. In particular, AI programs seem to grasp ideas and concepts. For example, some can understand natural languages, some can see or perform difficult assembly tasks, and others can infer new information from facts provided to the system. However, software that makes computers seem intelligent is not that different from any other kind of software.",,

Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, in which fuzzy sets (membership functions) and their logic operations are determined by a consistent algorithm according to the distributions of original data and the semantics of the fuzzy concepts, is applied to study some new techniques of feature selection, concept categorization and characteristic description; problems often encountered in artificial intelligence area such as machine learning and pattern recognition. These techniques developed under the framework of AFS theory in this paper are more simple and more interpretable than the conventional methods, since they imitate the human recognition process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection, the concept categorization and the characteristic description, these new techniques are applied to fuzzy clustering problems. Several benchmark data sets are used for this purpose. Clustering accuracies are comparable with or superior to the conventional algorithms such as FCM, k-means, and the new algorithm such as single point iterative weighted fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.",,

By this means, the concept of optimality is introduced. The paper then addresses the problem of discovering optimal machines using programmable methods. The requirement for proofs of methods is emphasized. Apparent ways of limiting the difficulties encountered are shown to be deceptive. Finally, the effect achieved by changing the required format is illustrated.",,
