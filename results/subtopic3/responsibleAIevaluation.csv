Tools and Practices for Responsible AI Engineering,Hydra-zen simplifies the process of making complex AI applications configurable and their behaviors reproducible.,Search,2022,,"Ryan  Soklaski, Justin  Goodwin, Olivia  Brown, Michael  Yee, Jason  Matterer",,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/9a15c604696e672d2ccbcc07d36bf38ba3817bba,,"Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI)—the practice of developing, evaluating, and maintaining accurate AI systems that also exhibit essential properties such as robustness and explainability—represents a multifaceted challenge that often stretches standard machine learning tooling, frameworks, and testing methods beyond their limits. In this paper, we present two new software libraries—hydra-zen and the rAI-toolbox—that address critical needs for responsible AI engineering. hydra-zen dramatically simplifies the process of making complex AI applications configurable, and their behaviors reproducible. The rAI-toolbox is designed to enable methods for evaluating and enhancing the robustness of AI-models in a way that is scalable and that composes naturally with other popular ML frameworks. We describe the design principles and methodologies that make these tools effective, including the use of property-based testing to bolster the reliability of the tools themselves. Finally, we demonstrate the composability and flexibility of the tools by showing how various use cases from adversarial robustness and explainable AI can be concisely implemented with familiar APIs.",,
Responsible AI Challenges in End-to-end Machine Learning,FairBatch is a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use.,Search,2021,,"Steven Euijong Whang, Ki Hyun Tae, Yuji  Roh, Geon  Heo",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0233cd95dd0bc327dd72a14d60216c98021250ab,,"Responsible AI is becoming critical as AI is widely used in our everyday lives. Many companies that deploy AI publicly state that when training a model, we not only need to improve its accuracy, but also need to guarantee that the model does not discriminate against users (fairness), is resilient to noisy or poisoned data (robustness), is explainable, and more. In addition, these objectives are not only relevant to model training, but to all steps of end-to-end machine learning, which include data collection, data cleaning and validation, model training, model evaluation, and model management and serving. Finally, responsible AI is conceptually challenging, and supporting all the objectives must be as easy as possible. We thus propose three key research directions towards this vision – depth, breadth, and usability – to measure progress and introduce our ongoing research. First, responsible AI must be deeply supported where multiple objectives like fairness and robust must be handled together. To this end, we propose FR-Train, a holistic framework for fair and robust model training in the presence of data bias and poisoning. Second, responsible AI must be broadly supported, preferably in all steps of machine learning. Currently we focus on the data pre-processing steps and propose Slice Tuner, a selective data acquisition framework for training fair and accurate models, and MLClean, a data cleaning framework that also improves fairness and robustness. Finally, responsible AI must be usable where the techniques must be easy to deploy and actionable. We propose FairBatch, a batch selection approach for fairness that is effective and simple to use, and Slice Finder, a model evaluation tool that automatically finds problematic slices. We believe we scratched the surface of responsible AI for end-to-end machine learning and suggest research challenges moving forward.",,
How evaluation guides AI research,Evaluation should be a mechanism of progress both within and across AI research projects.,Search,1988,99,"Paul  Coehn, Adele E. Howe",,,10.1609/AIMAG.V9I4.952,https://doi.org/10.1609/AIMAG.V9I4.952,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f086fbbb78e4dea8433e1ab3ba1563a092a5b68d,,"Evaluation should be a mechanism of progress both within and across AI research projects. For the individual, evaluation can tell us how and why our methods and programs work and, so, tell us how our research should proceed. For the community, evaluation expedites the understanding of available methods and, so, their integration into further research. In this article, we present a five-stage model of AI research and describe guidelines for evaluation that are appropriate for each stage. These guidelines, in the form of evaluation criteria and techniques, suggest how to perform evaluation. We conclude with a set of recommendations that suggest how to encourage the evaluation of AI research.",,

"AI Evaluation: past, present and future",AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable.,Search,2014,24,José  Hernández-Orallo,ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8f2d78fb9293eac038a6a431d23ca5a18df7bfb4,,"Artificial intelligence develops techniques and systems whose performance must be evaluated on a regular basis in order to certify and foster progress in the discipline. We will describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We see that black-box (behavioural evaluation) is becoming more and more common, as AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable. We identify three kinds of evaluation: Human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe the limitations of the many evaluation settings and competitions in these three categories and propose several ideas for a more systematic and robust evaluation. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more general approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.",,
Responsible AI Tutorial,A key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models.,Search,2022,,"Dr Mukta Paliwal, Dattaraj  Rao, Amogh Kamat Tarcar",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3493700.3493769,https://doi.org/10.1145/3493700.3493769,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/04b7d3004cdf971ea05803fbe39c25de561afcc5,,"There is rapid technical progress and widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based products and workflows influencing many aspects of human and business activities like banking, healthcare, advertising and many more. Although accuracy of AI models is undoubtedly the most important factor considered while deploying AI based products, there is urgent need to understand how AI can be designed to operate responsibly. Responsible AI is a framework that each software developing organization needs to adapt to build customer trust in the transparency, accountability, fairness, and security of deployed AI solutions. At the same time a key aspect to making AI responsible is to have a development pipeline that can promote reproducibility of results and manage the lineage of data and ML models. This tutorial will throw light on these aspects of Responsible AI with a working example demonstrating the concept. The intent of the tutorial will be to equip the audience with enough knowledge of the concepts along with code to gain appreciation for the importance of building Responsible AI.",,
Responsible AI for Digital Health: a Synthesis and a Research Agenda,Issues regarding each of the areas of responsible AI pose moral and ethical consequences in a health context.,Search,2021,11,"Cristina  Trocin, Patrick  Mikalef, Zacharoula  Papamitsiou, Kieran  Conboy",Information Systems Frontiers,,10.1007/s10796-021-10146-4,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10796-021-10146-4,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/758289be073e7d4e6be6e6e4a7f937ef48ae81bd,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10796-021-10146-4.pdf,"Responsible AI is concerned with the design, implementation and use of ethical, transparent, and accountable AI technology in order to reduce biases, promote fairness, equality, and to help facilitate interpretability and explainability of outcomes, which are particularly pertinent in a healthcare context. However, the extant literature on health AI reveals significant issues regarding each of the areas of responsible AI, posing moral and ethical consequences. This is particularly concerning in a health context where lives are at stake and where there are significant sensitivities that are not as pertinent in other domains outside of health. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of health AI using responsible AI concepts as a structural lens. A systematic literature review supported our data collection and sampling procedure, the corresponding analysis, and extraction of research themes helped us provide an evidence-based foundation. We contribute with a systematic description and explanation of the intellectual structure of Responsible AI in digital health and develop an agenda for future research.",,Review
Principles and business processes for responsible AI,A risk assessment approach is required to responsibly manage AI from an organization's perspective.,Search,2019,25,Roger  Clarke,Comput.

This second article discusses how an organisation can manage AI responsibly, in order to protect its own interests, but also those of its stakeholders and society as a whole. A limited amount of guidance is provided by ethical analysis. A much more effective approach is to apply adapted forms of the established techniques of risk assessment and risk management. Critically, risk assessment needs to be undertaken not only with the organisation's own interests in focus, but also from the perspectives of other stakeholders. To underpin this new form of business process, a set of Principles for Responsible AI is presented, consolidating proposals put forward by a diverse collection of 30 organisations.",,
Measures and Best Practices for Responsible AI,,Search,2021,,"Sunipa  Dev, Mehrnoosh  Sameki, Jwala  Dhamala, Cho-Jui  Hsieh",KDD,,10.1145/3447548.3469458,https://doi.org/10.1145/3447548.3469458,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7b7f889440dd3bbb234ca5a0033b28bef1db0144,,"The use of machine learning (ML) based systems has become ubiquitous including their usage in critical applications like medicine and assistive technologies. Therefore, it is important to determine the trustworthiness of these ML models and tasks. A key component in this determination is the development of task specific datasets, metrics, and best practices which are able to measure the various aspects of responsible model development and deployment including robustness, interpretability and fairness. Further, datasets are also key when training for a given task, be it coreference resolution in language modeling or facial recognition in computer vision. Imbalances and inadequate representation in datasets can have repercussions of an undesirable nature. Some common examples include how coreference resolution systems in NLU are often not all gender inclusive, discrepancies in the measurement of how robust and trustworthy machine predictions are in domains where the selective labels problem is prevalent, and discriminatory determination of pain or care levels of people belonging to different demographics in health science applications. Development of task specific datasets which do better in this regard is also extremely vital. In this workshop, we invite contributions towards different (i) datasets which help enhance task performance and inclusivity, (ii) measures and metrics which help in determining the trustworthiness of a model/dataset, (iii) assessment or remediation tools for fairer, more transparent, robust, and reliable models, and (iv) case studies describing responsible development and deployment of AI systems across fields such as healthcare, financial services, insurance, etc. The datasets, measures, mitigation techniques, and best practices could focus on different areas including (but not restricted to) the following: Fairness and Bias Robustness Reliability and Safety Interpretability Explainability Ethical AI Causal Inference Counterfactual Example Analysis They could also be focussed on the applications in diverse fields such as industry, finance, healthcare and beyond. Text based datasets can be in languages other than English as well.",,

Unfortunately, it's difficult to create a set of publication norms for responsible AI because the field of AI is currently fragmented in terms of how this technology is researched, developed, funded, etc. To examine this challenge and find solutions, the Montreal AI Ethics Institute (MAIEI) collaborated with the Partnership on AI in May 2020 to host two public consultation meetups. These meetups examined potential publication norms for responsible AI, with the goal of creating a clear set of recommendations and ways forward for publishers.

In its submission, MAIEI provides six initial recommendations, these include: 1) create tools to navigate publication decisions, 2) offer a page number extension, 3) develop a network of peers, 4) require broad impact statements, 5) require the publication of expected results, and 6) revamp the peer-review process. After considering potential concerns regarding these recommendations, including constraining innovation and creating a ""black market"" for AI research, MAIEI outlines three ways forward for publishers, these include: 1) state clearly and consistently the need for established norms, 2) coordinate and build trust as a community, and 3) change the approach.",,Review

In this study, 10 responsible AI cases were selected from different industries to better understand the use of responsible AI in practices. Four responsible AI practices are identified, including governance, ethically design solutions, risk control and training and education and five strategies for firms who are considering to adopt responsible AI practices are recommended.",,

We discuss three notions of responsibility (i.e., blameworthiness, accountability, and liability) for all stakeholders, including AI, and suggest the roles of jurisdiction and the general public in this matter.",,
Responsible AI—Two Frameworks for Ethical Design Practice,,Search,2020,28,"Dorian  Peters, Karina  Vold, Diana  Robinson, Rafael A.

This move came amidst a growing public concern over the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence (AI), compounded by the lack of an anticipatory process for attending to ethical impact within professional practice. However, the difficulty in moving from principles to practice presents a significant challenge to the implementation of ethical guidelines. Herein, we describe two complementary frameworks for integrating ethical analysis into engineering practice to help address this challenge. We then provide the outcomes of an ethical analysis informed by these frameworks, conducted within the specific context of Internet-delivered therapy in digital mental health. We hope both the frameworks and analysis can provide tools and insights, not only for the context of digital healthcare but also for data-enabled and intelligent technology development more broadly.",,

Applications range from hiring and credit limit decisions, to loan and healthcare claim approvals, to criminal sentencing, and even the selective provision of information by social media companies to different groups of viewers. The increased adoption of AI, affecting so many aspects of our daily lives, highlights the potential risks around automated decision making and the need for better governance and ethical standards when deploying such systems. In response to that need, governments, states, municipalities, private sector organizations, and industry groups around the world have drafted hundreds, perhaps even thousands at this point - of new, regulatory proposals and guidelines; many already in effect and more on the way. The data-driven and often black box nature of these systems does not absolve organizations from the social responsibility or increasingly commonplace regulatory requirements to confirm they work as intended and are deployed in a responsible manner, lest they run the risk of reputational damage, regulatory fines, and/or legal action. The legal community should have a good understanding of the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence in order to inform, translate, and advise on the legal implications of AI systems.",,
