Particularly in the field of education, AI applications promise immense innovation potential. A central focus in this field is on analyzing and evaluating learner characteristics to derive learning profiles and create individualized learning environments. The development and implementation of such AI-driven approaches are related to learners' data, and thus involves several privacies, ethics, and morality challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of human-centered AI, and consider how an AI system can be developed in line with human values without posing risks to humanity. Because the education market is in the early stages of incorporating AI into educational tools, we believe that this is the right time to raise awareness about the use of principles that foster human-centered values and help in building responsible, ethical, and value-oriented AI.",,
Human-Centered AI,"AI systems require the primary users to gain appropriate levels of trust, transparency regarding limitations, and reflective oversight.",Search,2021,4,"Hollen  Barmer, Rachel  Dzombak, Matthew  Gaston, Vijaykumar  Palat, Frank  Redner, Carol  Smith, Tanisha  Smith",,,10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/264b9b136889da3b4d7e50ef58c77678b35dc3e0,,"We identify three specific areas of focus to advance human-centered AI:• Designers and systems must understand the context of use and sense changes over time: Successful AI Engineering depends on the team’s ability to identify and articulate the desired system outcome and understand human and contextual factors affecting the outcome. The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans.,Search,2019,67,Mark O.

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,
Towards Human Centered Ambient Intelligence,A dynamic and active user model creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level.,Search,2008,4,"Thomas  Plötz, Christian  Kleine-Cosack, Gernot A.

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,

Human-centered Artificial Intelligence: A Multidimensional Approach towards Real World Evidence,An human-centered artificial intelligence can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modeling techniques.,Search,2019,3,"Bettina  Schneider, Petra Maria Asprion, Frank  Grimberg",ICEIS,,10.5220/0007715503810390,https://doi.org/10.5220/0007715503810390,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f831bf2857fe27c3211f602f2839dec59222f251,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/603b/6573fa4f30d51652c687e3a6ace0bf6d3c01.pdf,"This study indicates the significance of a human-centered perspective in the analysis and interpretation of Real World Data. As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived ‘Health-related Quality of Life’ is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated ‘Real World Evidence’. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modelling techniques. The outcome – a human-centered ‘Indicator Set’ can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives – the elementary, the algorithmic and – as novelty – the human-centered evidence. As conclusion, we claim that Real World Data are more valuable and applicable to achieve patient-centricity and personalization if the human-centered perspective is considered ‘by design’.",,

Advances so far have been largely technical with a focus on machine learning (ML). Only recently have we begun seeing a shift towards focusing on the human aspects of artificial intelligence, centered on the narrow view of making AI interactive and explainable. In this paper I suggest a definition for ""Interactive Human Centered Artificial Intelligence and outline the required properties. Staying in control is essential for humans to feel safe and have self-determination. Hence, we need to find ways for humans to understand AI based systems and means to allow human control and oversight. In our work, we argue that levels of abstractions and granularity of control are a general solution to this. Furthermore, it is essential that we make explicit why we want AI and what are the goals of AI research and development. We need to state the properties that we expect of future intelligent systems and who will benefit from a system or service. For me, AI and ML are very much comparable to raw materials (like stone, iron, or bronze). Historical periods are named after these materials as they fundamentally changed what humans can build and what tools humans can engineer. Hence, I argue that in the AI age we need to shift the focus from the material (e.g. the AI algorithms, as there will be plenty of material) towards the tools and infrastructures that are enabled which are beneficial to humans. It is apparent that AI will allow the automation of mental routine tasks and that it will extend our ability to perceive the world and foresee events. For me, the central question is how to create these tools for amplifying the human mind without compromising human values.",,

Psychological concepts like trust, mental models, and self-efficacy can serve as instruments to evaluate XAI approaches in empirical studies with end-users. First results in applications for education, healthcare, and industry suggest that one XAI does not fit all. Instead, the design of XAI has to consider user needs, personal background, and the specific task of the AI system.",,

However, most AI techniques are based on mathematical models that are difficult to understand by the general public, so most people use AI-based technology as a black box that they eventually start to trust based on their personal experience. This article proposes to go a step forward in the use of AI in IoT, and proposes a novel approach within the Human-centric AI field for generating explanations about the knowledge learned by a neural network (in particular a multilayer perceptron) from IoT environments. More concretely, this work proposes two techniques based on the analysis of artificial neuron weights, and another technique aimed at explaining each estimation based on the analysis of training cases. This approach has been illustrated in the context of a smart IoT kitchen that detects the user depression based on the food used for each meal, using a simulator for this purpose. The results revealed that most auto-generated explanations made sense in this context (i.e. 97.0%), and the execution times were low (i.e. 1.5 ms or lower) even considering the common configurations varying independently the number of neurons per hidden layer (up to 20), the number of hidden layers (up to 20) and the number of training cases (up to 4,000).",,
