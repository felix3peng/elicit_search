Human-Centered AI to Support an Adaptive Management of Human-Machine Transitions with Vehicle Automation,An AI algorithm was developed to support a adaptive management of human-machine transitions with vehicle automation.,Search,2021,,"Thierry  Bellet, Aurélie  Banet, Marie  Petiot, Bertrand  Richard, Joshua  Quick",Inf.,,10.3390/info12010013,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12010013,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/769123129db332832f7bf5b056ae3294fcebc19d,https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/1/13/pdf,"This article is about the Human-Centered Design (HCD), development and evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm aiming to support an adaptive management of Human-Machine Transition (HMT) between car drivers and vehicle automation. The general principle of this algorithm is to monitor (1) the drivers’ behaviors and (2) the situational criticality to manage in real time the Human-Machine Interactions (HMI). This Human-Centered AI (HCAI) approach was designed from real drivers’ needs, difficulties and errors observed at the wheel of an instrumented car. Then, the HCAI algorithm was integrated into demonstrators of Advanced Driving Aid Systems (ADAS) implemented on a driving simulator (dedicated to highway driving or to urban intersection crossing). Finally, user tests were carried out to support their evaluation from the end-users point of view. Thirty participants were invited to practically experience these ADAS supported by the HCAI algorithm. To increase the scope of this evaluation, driving simulator experiments were implemented among three groups of 10 participants, corresponding to three highly contrasted profiles of end-users, having respectively a positive, neutral or reluctant attitude towards vehicle automation. After having introduced the research context and presented the HCAI algorithm designed to contextually manage HMT with vehicle automation, the main results collected among these three profiles of future potential end users are presented. In brief, main findings confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of the HCAI algorithm, its benefits regarding drivers’ satisfaction, and the high levels of acceptance, perceived utility, usability and attractiveness of this new type of “adaptive vehicle automation”.",,

These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.",,

In this paper, we introduce Human-centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) as an approach that puts the human at the center of technology design. It develops a holistic understanding of ""who"" the human is by considering the interplay of values, interpersonal dynamics, and the socially situated nature of AI systems. In particular, we advocate for a reflective sociotechnical approach. We illustrate HCXAI through a case study of an explanation system for non-technical end-users that shows how technical advancements and the understanding of human factors co-evolve. Building on the case study, we lay out open research questions pertaining to further refining our understanding of ""who"" the human is and extending beyond 1-to-1 human-computer interactions. Finally, we propose that a reflective HCXAI paradigm-mediated through the perspective of Critical Technical Practice and supplemented with strategies from HCI, such as value-sensitive design and participatory design--not only helps us understand our intellectual blind spots, but it can also open up new design and research spaces.",,

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,

The system draws on a diverse set of AI technologies that are linked within a Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent system. Although the system provides a number of automated functions, the overall framework is highly user centric in its support for human needs, responsiveness to human inputs, and adaptivity to user working style and preferences.",,

Human-Centered Explainable AI (XAI): From Algorithms to User Experiences,AI explainability requirements have become an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI.,Search,2021,1,"Q.

With the rich application opportunities, explainability has moved beyond a demand by data scientists or researchers to comprehend the models they develop, to become an essential requirement for people to trust and adopt AI deployed in numerous domains. However, explainability is an inherently human-centric property and the field is starting to embrace human-centered approaches. Human-computer interaction (HCI) research and user experience (UX) design in this area are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter, we begin with a high-level overview of the technical landscape of XAI algorithms, then selectively survey our own and other recent HCI works that take human-centered approaches to design, evaluate, provide conceptual and methodological tools for XAI. We ask the question “what are human-centered approaches doing for XAI” and highlight three roles that they play in shaping XAI technologies by helping navigate, assess and expand the XAI toolbox: to drive technical choices by users’ explainability needs, to uncover pitfalls of existing XAI methods and inform new methods, and to provide conceptual frameworks for human-compatible XAI.",,Review

The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,

With increased digitization, the healthcare sector is shifting towards implementing digital technologies for data management and in administration. New technologies offer better treatment opportunities and streamline clinical workflow, but the complexity can cause ineffectiveness, frustration, and errors. To address this, we believe digital solutions alone are not sufficient. Therefore, we take a human-centred design approach for AI development, and apply systems engineering methods to identify system leverage points. We demonstrate how automation enables monitoring clinical parameters, using existing non-intrusive sensor technology, resulting in more resources toward patient care. Furthermore, we provide a framework on digitization of clinical data for integration with data management.

Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are essential parameters, necessary for evaluating patients in mental health wards. Ideally logging the parameters should take place at hourly intervals; however, time constraints and lack of resources restrict the nursing staff to consolidating the overall impression during the day, relying on what they recall. Using design methods, sensors (e.g. infrared, proximity, pressure) are used to automate the acquisition of data for machine learning that correspond to the ADLs, considering privacy and other medical requirements.

We present a concept of a room with sensors that can be deployed in clinical settings. Sensor data log ADLs, and provide machine learning data. A theoretical framework demonstrates how collected data can be used in electronic/medical health records.

Data acquisition of the ADLs with automation enable variable specificity and sensitivity on-demand. It further facilitates interoperability and provides data for machine learning.

Our research demonstrates automated data acquisition techniques for clinical monitoring. Human centered AI design approach enables on-demand analysis of ADLs for mental health treatment.",,
