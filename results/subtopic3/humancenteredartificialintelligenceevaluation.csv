On Design and Evaluation of Human-centered Explainable AI systems,"Viewing AI explanations can help establish rapport, confidence, and understanding between the AI agent and the user.",Search,2019,5,Upol  Ehsan,,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/224b00003cdaa9f698be41520a3164d67d47951f,,"AsAI systems become ubiquitous in our lives, the human side of the equation needs careful investigation. The challenges of designing and evaluating ""black-boxed"" AI systems depends crucially on who the human is in the loop. Explanations, viewed as a form of post-hoc interpretability, can help establish rapport, confidence, and understanding between the AI agent and the user, especially when it comes to understanding failures and unexpected AI behavior. To effectively design and evaluate explanation generation systems, we need deeper end-to-end investigations of incorporating fully-realized AI agents and automated explanation generation systems into user studies. In this paper, we present a case study that focuses on how non-expert users perceive different styles of automatically generated rationales by an AI agent along the dimensions of confidence, humanlike-ness, adequate justification, and understandability. We summarize our results and provide a desiderata of research questions yet to be addressed.",,

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,

These systems have lately become an inseparable part of human lives. However, incorrect use leading to unintended consequences, safety, fairness, trustworthiness are major concerns of these emerging ubiquitous systems. In this paper, an attempt was made to concisely present and discuss key human-centered functional requirement specifications of emerging Artificial intelligence-based systems especially interpretability, explainability, fairness, transparency and security. Some emerging toolkits and open libraries for developing and evaluating AI-based systems are also discussed. A number of open problems with respect to managing the tradeoff among these requirements and systems’ performance are presented to guide future researches in this direction.",,
Towards Human-Centered AI: Psychological concepts as foundation for empirical XAI research,End-users with no experience in machine learning may perceive XAI techniques to shed light on AI systems differently.,Search,2021,,Katharina  Weitz,it - Information Technology,,10.1515/itit-2021-0047,https://doi.org/10.1515/itit-2021-0047,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/1b11c9fc8c6bce9dd50504282fcd7eaef06ebeb7,,"Abstract Human-Centered AI is a widely requested goal for AI applications. To reach this is explainable AI promises to help humans to understand the inner workings and decisions of AI systems. While different XAI techniques have been developed to shed light on AI systems, it is still unclear how end-users with no experience in machine learning perceive these. Psychological concepts like trust, mental models, and self-efficacy can serve as instruments to evaluate XAI approaches in empirical studies with end-users. First results in applications for education, healthcare, and industry suggest that one XAI does not fit all. Instead, the design of XAI has to consider user needs, personal background, and the specific task of the AI system.",,

Particularly in the field of education, AI applications promise immense innovation potential. A central focus in this field is on analyzing and evaluating learner characteristics to derive learning profiles and create individualized learning environments. The development and implementation of such AI-driven approaches are related to learners' data, and thus involves several privacies, ethics, and morality challenges. In this paper, we introduce the concept of human-centered AI, and consider how an AI system can be developed in line with human values without posing risks to humanity. Because the education market is in the early stages of incorporating AI into educational tools, we believe that this is the right time to raise awareness about the use of principles that foster human-centered values and help in building responsible, ethical, and value-oriented AI.",,

Human-centered Artificial Intelligence: A Multidimensional Approach towards Real World Evidence,An iterative methodology using hermeneutics outlines the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence.,Search,2019,3,"Bettina  Schneider, Petra Maria Asprion, Frank  Grimberg",ICEIS,,10.5220/0007715503810390,https://doi.org/10.5220/0007715503810390,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f831bf2857fe27c3211f602f2839dec59222f251,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/603b/6573fa4f30d51652c687e3a6ace0bf6d3c01.pdf,"This study indicates the significance of a human-centered perspective in the analysis and interpretation of Real World Data. As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived ‘Health-related Quality of Life’ is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated ‘Real World Evidence’. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modelling techniques. The outcome – a human-centered ‘Indicator Set’ can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives – the elementary, the algorithmic and – as novelty – the human-centered evidence. As conclusion, we claim that Real World Data are more valuable and applicable to achieve patient-centricity and personalization if the human-centered perspective is considered ‘by design’.",,

Human-centered artificial intelligence is a perspective on AI and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness that they are part of a larger system consisting of humans. We lay forth an argument that human-centered artificial intelligence can be broken down into two aspects: (1) AI systems that understand humans from a sociocultural perspective, and (2) AI systems that help humans understand them. We further argue that issues of social responsibility such as fairness, accountability, interpretability, and transparency.",,

The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,
