Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,The European Commission's AI high-level expert group defined seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,

However, there is no uniform definition on trusted AI. In the paper, we make a survey on related works on artificial intelligence principles and ethical guidelines. Then analyze the ethical foundations of trusted AI and give a definition on trusted AI. We propose specific requirements of trusted AI from a technical perspective and give explanations on these technique requirements. Finally, best practices are recommended to achieve trusted AI and promote the responsible use of AI.",,

Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US$1 billion in 2016 to a US$34.8 billion net worth by 2025. The latest national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments explicitly mention AI capabilities. At the same time, initiatives to define new standards and certification procedures to elicit users’ trust in AI are emerging on a global scale. However, trust in AI (both machine learning and neural networks) to deliver cybersecurity tasks is a double-edged sword: it can improve substantially cybersecurity practices, but can also facilitate new forms of attacks to the AI applications themselves, which may pose severe security threats. We argue that trust in AI for cybersecurity is unwarranted and that, to reduce security risks, some form of control to ensure the deployment of ‘reliable AI’ for cybersecurity is necessary. To this end, we offer three recommendations focusing on the design, development and deployment of AI for cybersecurity.Current national cybersecurity and defence strategies of several governments mention explicitly the use of AI. However, it will be important to develop standards and certification procedures, which involves continuous monitoring and assessment of threats. The focus should be on the reliability of AI-based systems, rather than on eliciting users’ trust in AI.",,

Guidelines for Trustworthy AI application in clinical trials,The European Commission established the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).,Search,2020,,"N  Leventi, A  Vodenitcharova, K  Popova",,,10.1093/eurpub/ckaa165.806,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa165.806,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/29898969890b3d4d8a5813a6750d308b3fb7117e,https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article-pdf/30/Supplement_5/ckaa165.806/33817815/ckaa165.806.pdf,"Innovative information technologies (IIT) like artificial intelligence (AI), big data, etc. promise to support individual patient care, and promote public health. Their use raises ethical, social and legal issues. Here we demonstrate how the guidelines for trustworthy AI, can assist to answer those ethical issues in the case of clinical trials (CT).

In 2018 the European Commission established the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). The group proposed Guidelines to promote Trustworthy AI, with three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle, as it should be lawful, ethical and robust.

Trustworthiness is a prerequisite for people and societies to develop, and use AI systems. We used a focus group methodology to explore how the guidelines for trustworthy AI can assist to answer the ethical issues that rise by the application of AI in CTs.

The discussion was directed to the seven requirements for trustworthy AI in CTs, by questions like:

Are they relevant in CTs as a whole? Would they be applicable to the use of IIT as AI in CTs? Are you currently applying part, or all, of the proposed list? In the future, would you attach some, or all, of the proposed list? Is the administrative burden of applying the requirements justified by the effect?

It was recommended that:

the guidelines are relevant in the conduct of the CT; planning and implementation of CTs using IIT, should take them into account; ethical aspects and challenges are of the utmost importance; the proposed list is a very comprehensive framework; particular attention should be paid where more vulnerable groups are affected; the administrative burden is acceptable, as the effect exceeds the resources invested.

IIT are becoming increasingly important in medicine, and requirements for trustworthy IIT, and AI are necessary. Appropriate instrument in the case of the CTs are the provided by AI HLEG guidelines.",,

Traceability in AI shares part of its scope with general purpose recommendations for provenance as W3C PROV, and it is also supported to different extents by specific tools used by practitioners as part of their efforts in making data analytic processes reproducible or repeatable. Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review

Moreover, there are complexities associated with meeting the specific dimensions of Trustworthy AI best practices such as data governance, conformance testing, quality assurance of AI model behaviors, transparency, accountability, and confidentiality requirements. These processes involve multiple steps, hand-offs, re-works, and human-in-the-loop oversight. In this paper, we demonstrate that process mining can provide a useful framework for gaining fact-based visibility to AI compliance process execution, surfacing compliance bottlenecks, and providing for an automated approach to analyze, remediate and monitor uncertainty in AI regulatory compliance processes.",,

As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems.
