Principled animation of artificial intelligence algorithms,Animation is an important component of modern computing and can elucidate many key features.,Search,1993,,Mark W. Perlin,Proceedings of 1993 IEEE Conference on Tools with Al (TAI-93),,10.1109/TAI.1993.633939,https://doi.org/10.1109/TAI.1993.633939,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/11e390f13260a8e0cfb2bcd535cf3e250ae1a4f6,,"Visualization is an important component of modern computing. By animating the course of an algorithm's temporal execution, many key features can be elucidated. The author has developed a general framework, termed Call-Graph Caching (CGC), for automating the construction of many complex AI algorithms. By incorporating visualization into CGC interpreters, principled animations can be automatically displayed as AI computations unfold. Systems that support the automation animation of AI algorithms must address these three design issues: how to represent AI data structures in a general, uniform way that leads to perspicuous animation and efficient redisplay; how to coordinate the succession of graphical events; and how to partition AI graphs to provide for separate, uncluttered displays. CGC provides a natural and effective solution to all these concerns. The author describes the CGC method, including detailed examples, and discusses why CGC works well for animation. He discusses the CACHE system, the CGC environment for AI algorithm animation. Finally, the author demonstrates the animation of several AI algorithms-RETE match, linear unification, arc consistency, chart parsing, and truth maintenance-all of which have been implemented in CACHE.",,

Unifying Principles and Metrics for Safe and Assistive AI,AI safety focuses on designing AI systems that allow humans to safely instruct and control AI systems.,Search,2021,4,Siddharth  Srivastava,AAAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/967cba5849f93869655af8d3d8fda9b0a3304a1d,,"The prevalence and success of AI applications have been tempered by concerns about the controllability of AI systems about AI’s impact on the future of work. These concerns reflect two aspects of a central question: how would humans work with AI systems? While research on AI safety focuses on designing AI systems that allow humans to safely instruct and control AI systems, research on AI and the future of work focuses on the impact of AI on humans who may be unable to do so. This Blue Sky Ideas paper proposes a unifying set of declarative principles that enable a more uniform evaluation of arbitrary AI systems along multiple dimensions of the extent to which they are suitable for use by specific classes of human operators. It leverages recent AI research and the unique strengths of the field to develop human-centric principles for AI systems that address the concerns noted above.",,
Analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence for intelligent machines,"A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution is necessary to implement hierarchically intelligent control on an intelligent machine.",Search,1989,192,George N.

New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,

Generalizing AI: Challenges and Opportunities for Plug and Play AI Solutions,"Plug and Play AI tools require training, parameter fine-tunings, and data set selection for optimal features extraction.",Search,2021,16,"Ismaeel Al Ridhawi, Safa  Otoum, Moayad  Aloqaily, Azzedine  Boukerche",IEEE Network,,10.1109/MNET.011.2000371,https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.011.2000371,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5081f7b388134cbfc90bc41b1d7b5597ef59541,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized today's Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services by introducing significant technological enhancements across a multitude of domains. With the deployment of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication network, smart city visions of fast, on-demand, intelligent user-specific services are now becoming a reality. The concept of connected IoT is evolving into connected intelligent things. The advancements of both AI techniques, coupled with the sophistication of edge devices, is now leading to a new era of connected intelligence. Moving the intelligence toward end devices must account for latency demands and simplicity of selecting the type of AI technique to be used. Moreover, since most AI techniques require learning from big data sets and reasoning using a multitude of classification patterns, new simplified and collaborative solutions are now necessary more than ever. As such, the concept of introducing decentralized and distributed ‘Plug and Play’ (PnP) AI tools is now becoming more attractive given the vast numbers in edge devices, data volume and AI techniques. To this end, this article envisions a novel general AI solution that can be adapted to autonomously select the type of machine learning (ML) algorithm, the data set to be used, and provide reasoning in regards to data selection for optimal features extraction. Moreover, the solution performs the necessary training and all the necessary parameter fine-tunings to achieve the highest level of generality and simplicity for AI at the edge. We explore several aspects related to PnP-AI and its impact in the smart city ecosystem.",,
Introduction: Tools and Techniques of Artificial Intelligence,Several papers apply AI techniques to problems not thought of as AI problems at first glance.,Search,2003,2,"Ingrid  Russell, Susan M.

Of the 125 papers published in 2001 and 104 papers in 2002, twenty contributors were invited to submit expanded versions of their work. Of these, ten were selected for this special issue of IJPRAI. Several papers present a novel application of an AI technique to a problem typically considered to be in the AI domain. For example, natural language resources are used to improve information retrieval, user modeling techniques are used to develop strategies for game playing, and agent oriented methodologies are used in robotics. In contrast, some papers apply AI techniques to problems not thought of as AI problems at first glance: machine learning is used in bioinformatics and decision support techniques are applied to water resource management. Finally, some of the papers present extensions and improvements to AI methodologies: representing constraint satisfaction problems and combining supervised and unsupervised learning in a single mechanism. An important constraint in information retrieval is time — answers must be returned in time. Several researchers have considered using WordNet, a natural language resource, to improve the quality of information retrieval. However, the fine granularity of word sense representation in WordNet makes it difficult to apply to the problem of information retrieval to get results in time. In the first paper, Mihalcea proposes a solution to this problem, a set of methods that automatically transforms WordNet into a coarse grained dictionary appropriate for information retrieval.",,

In our recent Software Engineering research, we investigated on the design of novel AI methods to facilitate all three major phases in software engineering: development, operation, and analysis. In this talk, I will first introduce the AI techniques we employed, including machine learning framework, classification, clustering, matrix factorization, topic modeling, deep learning, and parallel computing platform. Then I will explain the challenges in each phase and describe our recently proposed methodologies. First in development phase, we suggested an automated code completion technique via deep learning. Our technique learns the code style from lots of existing code bases, and recommends the most suitable token based on the trained deep learning model and current coding context. Besides, to help developers in conducting effective logging, we designed a tool named LogAdvisor, which tells developers whether they should write a logging statement in the current code block or not. Secondly, in operation phase, we implemented a continuous and passive authentication method for mobile phones based on user touch biometrics. Different from the traditional password authentication scheme, our method can recognize malicious attackers based on abnormal user behaviors. Moreover, we developed PAID, which automatically prioritizes app issues by mining user reviews. Finally, in analysis phase, we designed systematic data analytics techniques for software reliability prediction. Besides, to make full use of the crucial runtime information, we proposed effective methods for every step in log analysis, including log parsing, feature extraction, and log mining. Furthermore, we developed a CNN-based defect prediction method to help developers find the buggy code. In the end, we expect to establish a comprehensive framework for systematic employment of AI techniques in the Software Engineering paradigm.",,Review
Signs for Ethical AI: A Route Towards Transparency,"Today, AI fuels some of the most significant economic and research institutions in the world.",Search,2020,1,"Dario  Garcia-Gasulla, Atia  Cort'es, Sergio  Alvarez-Napagao, Ulises  Cort'es",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a9666a839d6b5f144714e62d61477a25a45fdec1,,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently raised to the point where it has a direct impact on the daily life of billions of people. This is the result of its application to sectors like finance, health, digital entertainment, transportation, security and advertisement. Today, AI fuels some of the most significant economic and research institutions in the world, and the impact of AI in the near future seems difficult to predict or even bound. In contrast to all this power, society remains mostly ignorant of the capabilities, requirements and standard practices of AI today. Society is becoming aware of the dangers that come with that ignorance, and is rightfully asking for solutions. To address this need, improving on current practices of interaction between people and AI systems, we propose a transparency scheme to be implemented on any AI system open to the public. The scheme is based on two main pillars: Data Privacy and AI Transparency. The first recognizes the relevance of data for AI and is supported by GDPR, the most important legislation on the topic. The second considers aspects of AI transparency yet to be regulated: AI capacity, purpose and source. Lacking legislation to build upon, we design this pillar based on fundamental ethical principles. For each of the two pillars, we define a three-level display. The first level is based on visual signs, inspired by traffic signs managing the interaction between people and cars, and designed for quick and universal interpretability. The second level uses a factsheet system, providing further detail while still abstracting the subject. The last level provides access to all available details. After detailing and exemplifying the proposed transparency scheme, we define a set of principles for creating transparent by design software, to be used during the integration of AI components on user-oriented services.",,
