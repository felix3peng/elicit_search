Human-Centered AI,"AI systems require the primary users to gain appropriate levels of trust, transparency regarding limitations, and reflective oversight.",Search,2021,4,"Hollen  Barmer, Rachel  Dzombak, Matthew  Gaston, Vijaykumar  Palat, Frank  Redner, Carol  Smith, Tanisha  Smith",,,10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://doi.org/10.1184/R1/16560183.V1,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/264b9b136889da3b4d7e50ef58c77678b35dc3e0,,"We identify three specific areas of focus to advance human-centered AI:• Designers and systems must understand the context of use and sense changes over time: Successful AI Engineering depends on the team’s ability to identify and articulate the desired system outcome and understand human and contextual factors affecting the outcome. The system itself must be able to learn when shifts in context have occurred. What are the best ways to maintain clarity around operational intent and mechanisms for adapting and evolving systems based on dynamic contexts and user needs? • Development of tools, processes, and practices to scope and facilitate human-machine teaming: Implementation of AI systems entails high levels of interdependence between human and machine. Adoption of AI systems requires the primary users to interact with and understand systems, gaining appropriate levels of trust. Every AI system needs to be designed to recognize boundaries and unfamiliar scenarios, and to provide transparency regarding its limitations. • Methods, mechanisms, and mindsets to engage in critical oversight: AI systems learn through data and observations, rather than being explicitly programmed for a deterministic outcome. Critical and reflective oversight by organizations, teams, and individuals that create and use AI systems is needed to uphold ethical principles and proactively consider the risks of bias, misuse, abuse, and unintended consequences through design, development, and ongoing deployment.For each area, we identify ongoing work as well and challenges and opportunities in developing and deploying AI systems with confidence.",,
Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence: Three Fresh Ideas,"A two-dimensional HCAI framework, a shift from emulating humans to empowering people, and a three-level governance structure can promote trustworthy HCAI systems.",Search,2020,32,Ben  Shneiderman,,,10.17705/1thci.00131,https://doi.org/10.17705/1thci.00131,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/454af1728ba52b16965f7d18fc9301d0ffb6d708,https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1136&context=thci,"Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is a promising direction for designing AI systems that support human self-efficacy, promote creativity, clarify responsibility, and facilitate social participation. These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.",,

Not only in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving or medicine, but also in dynamic open world systems in industry and government it is crucial for predictive models to be uncertainty-aware and yield trustworthy predictions. Another key requirement for deployment of AI at enterprise scale is to realize the importance of integrating human-centered design into AI systems such that humans are able to use systems effectively, understand results and output, and explain findings to oversight committees.

While the focus of this symposium was on AI systems to improve data quality and technical robustness and safety, we welcomed submissions from broadly defined areas also discussing approaches addressing requirements such as explainable models, human trust and ethical aspects of AI.",,

How to center AI on humans,AI emulating human intelligence involves a shift from emulating intelligent human tasks to emulating human intelligence.,Search,2020,1,"Frank  Dignum, Virginia  Dignum",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/001d4ec84341de6c75a3ef4fffc6b77409979818,,"In this position paper we investigate what it means for AI to be human-centered. Although many organisations and researchers by now have given requirements for human-centeredness, such as: transparancy, respect for human autonomy, fairness and accountability, this does little to indicate how the AI techniques should be designed in order to be human-centered. In this paper we argue that human-centered AI involves a shift from AI emulating intelligent human tasks, to emulating human intelligence such that we capture enough social intelligence in order for the AI system to be able to center its activity and reasoning on its human users.",,

In this paper, we introduce Human-centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) as an approach that puts the human at the center of technology design. It develops a holistic understanding of ""who"" the human is by considering the interplay of values, interpersonal dynamics, and the socially situated nature of AI systems. In particular, we advocate for a reflective sociotechnical approach. We illustrate HCXAI through a case study of an explanation system for non-technical end-users that shows how technical advancements and the understanding of human factors co-evolve. Building on the case study, we lay out open research questions pertaining to further refining our understanding of ""who"" the human is and extending beyond 1-to-1 human-computer interactions. Finally, we propose that a reflective HCXAI paradigm-mediated through the perspective of Critical Technical Practice and supplemented with strategies from HCI, such as value-sensitive design and participatory design--not only helps us understand our intellectual blind spots, but it can also open up new design and research spaces.",,

The paper argues that humanistic design research should play a vital role in the pan-disciplinary collaboration with technologists and policymakers to mitigate the impact of AI. Ultimately, Human-centered Artificial Intelligence incorporates involving people and designing Artificial Intelligence systems for people through a genuine human-centered philosophy and approach.",,

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,
Human-Centered Approaches to Fair and Responsible AI,AI must account for the real-world contexts in which they will be embedded in order to actually work fairly.,Search,2020,5,"Min Kyung Lee, Nina  Grgić-Hlača, Michael Carl Tschantz, Reuben  Binns, Adrian  Weller, Michelle  Carney, Kori  Inkpen",CHI Extended Abstracts,,10.1145/3334480.3375158,https://doi.org/10.1145/3334480.3375158,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e02e25869b60f23c15bff7ffd8d406ff3321fca,,"As AI changes the way decisions are made in organizations and governments, it is ever more important to ensure that these systems work according to values that diverse users and groups find important. Researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic techniques to formalize statistical fairness notions, but emerging work suggests that AI systems must account for the real-world contexts in which they will be embedded in order to actually work fairly. These findings call for an expanded research focus beyond statistical fairness to that which includes fundamental understandings of human use and the social impact of AI systems, a theme central to the HCI community. The HCI community can contribute novel understandings, methods, and techniques for incorporating human values and cultural norms into AI systems; address human biases in developing and using AI; and empower individual users and society to audit and control AI systems. Our goal is to bring together academic and industry researchers in the fields of HCI, ML and AI, and the social sciences to devise a cross-disciplinary research agenda for fair and responsible AI systems. This workshop will build on previous algorithmic fairness workshops at AI and ML conferences, map research and design opportunities for future innovations, and disseminate them in each community.",,

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,

This is not only true for complex interaction scenarios like robots serving as guides, companions or members in a team, but also for more predefined functions like autonomous transport of people or goods. More and more, robots need suitable interfaces to interact with humans in a way that humans feel comfortable and that takes into account the need for a certain transparency about actions taken. The paper describes the requirements and state-of-the-art for a human-centered robotics research and development, including verbal and non-verbal interaction, understanding and learning from each other, as well as ethical questions that have to be dealt with if robots will be included in our everyday environment, influencing human life and societies.",,

To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. There is a need to chart the domain and shape the discourse of XAI with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of this workshop is to examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels.
