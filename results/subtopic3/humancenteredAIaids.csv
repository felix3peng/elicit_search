Human-Centered AI to Support an Adaptive Management of Human-Machine Transitions with Vehicle Automation,An algorithm designed to monitor and manage human-machine transitions was tested on driving simulators.,Search,2021,,"Thierry  Bellet, Aurélie  Banet, Marie  Petiot, Bertrand  Richard, Joshua  Quick",Inf.,,10.3390/info12010013,https://doi.org/10.3390/info12010013,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/769123129db332832f7bf5b056ae3294fcebc19d,https://www.mdpi.com/2078-2489/12/1/13/pdf,"This article is about the Human-Centered Design (HCD), development and evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm aiming to support an adaptive management of Human-Machine Transition (HMT) between car drivers and vehicle automation. The general principle of this algorithm is to monitor (1) the drivers’ behaviors and (2) the situational criticality to manage in real time the Human-Machine Interactions (HMI). This Human-Centered AI (HCAI) approach was designed from real drivers’ needs, difficulties and errors observed at the wheel of an instrumented car. Then, the HCAI algorithm was integrated into demonstrators of Advanced Driving Aid Systems (ADAS) implemented on a driving simulator (dedicated to highway driving or to urban intersection crossing). Finally, user tests were carried out to support their evaluation from the end-users point of view. Thirty participants were invited to practically experience these ADAS supported by the HCAI algorithm. To increase the scope of this evaluation, driving simulator experiments were implemented among three groups of 10 participants, corresponding to three highly contrasted profiles of end-users, having respectively a positive, neutral or reluctant attitude towards vehicle automation. After having introduced the research context and presented the HCAI algorithm designed to contextually manage HMT with vehicle automation, the main results collected among these three profiles of future potential end users are presented. In brief, main findings confirm the efficiency and the effectiveness of the HCAI algorithm, its benefits regarding drivers’ satisfaction, and the high levels of acceptance, perceived utility, usability and attractiveness of this new type of “adaptive vehicle automation”.",,
Human-Centered AI for Data Science: A Systematic Approach,AI can be designed to support human tasks while taking human needs into consideration and preserving human control.,Search,2021,,"Dakuo  Wang, Xiaojuan  Ma, April Yi Wang",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e40548c93b4c60ef66f7acd6bd8a64291a72c53e,,"Human-Centered AI (HCAI) refers to the research effort that aims to design and implement AI techniques to support various human tasks, while taking human needs into consideration and preserving human control. In this short position paper, we illustrate how we approach HCAI using a series of research projects around Data Science (DS) works as a case study. The AI techniques built for supporting DS works are collectively referred to as AutoML systems, and their goals are to automate some parts of the DS workflow. We illustrate a three-step systematical research approach (i.e., explore, build, and integrate) and four practical ways of implementation for HCAI systems. We argue that our work is a cornerstone towards the ultimate future of Human-AI Collaboration for DS and beyond, where AI and humans can take complementary and indispensable roles to achieve a better outcome and experience.",,

These human aspirations also encourage consideration of privacy, security, environmental protection, social justice, and human rights. This commentary reverses the current emphasis on algorithms and AI methods, by putting humans at the center of systems design thinking, in effect, a second Copernican Revolution. It offers three ideas: (1) a two-dimensional HCAI framework, which shows how it is possible to have both high levels of human control AND high levels of automation, (2) a shift from emulating humans to empowering people with a plea to shift language, imagery, and metaphors away from portrayals of intelligent autonomous teammates towards descriptions of powerful tool-like appliances and tele-operated devices, and (3) a three-level governance structure that describes how software engineering teams can develop more reliable systems, how managers can emphasize a safety culture across an organization, and how industry-wide certification can promote trustworthy HCAI systems. These ideas will be challenged by some, refined by others, extended to accommodate new technologies, and validated with quantitative and qualitative research. They offer a reframe -a chance to restart design discussions for products and services -which could bring greater benefits to individuals, families, communities, businesses, and society.",,

The greater the effect that AI has on humans, the more pressing the need is for us to understand it. This paper addresses research on the use of AI to evaluate new design methods and tools that can be leveraged to advance AI research, education, policy, and practice to improve the human condition. AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.",,

In order to close this emerging gap, we propose a concept aiming at boosting the adoption of AI and robotic related technologies to ensure sustainable, patient-centred care in hospitals. The planned assistance system will provide a continuous and safe monitoring of patients in the whole hospital environment from entrance to the ward, including data security and protection. The benefits consist in a fast detection of possible infected persons, a continuous monitoring of patients, a support by robots to reduce physical contacts during epidemics, and an automatic disinfection by robots. In addition to the technical challenges, medical, social and economic challenges for such an assistance system are discussed.",,Review

On the other hand, Machine Learning (ML) signifies a specific strategy meant to design smart systems whereby these systems can adapt to specific behaviors with respect to data. In the modern age, humans are rapidly collaborating with ML and AI systems. The AI that is human-based is a perspective of ML and AI, which algorithms have to be established with the awareness that they are a major segment of the massive system incorporating human.

The key aspect of the concept which we call human centered Ami is a dynamic and active user model which creates a virtual doppelganger of the user on software level. This agent not only complies to the specific characteristics of humans but directly affects and triggers environmental activities. In fact the user's persona and behavior is mapped to system level. Utilizing this doppelganger we introduce the integration of the users' capabilities and skills into the functionality of the environment. Human services enrich intelligent environments and allow to overcome the ""all-or-nothing"" dilemma which we identified in conventional approaches. The concept of human centered AmI is put into effect within the perception-oriented intelligent environment FINCA. Results of a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with real users show the benefits of the presented approach.",,

Our review and analysis highlight the new changes introduced by AI technology and the new challenges that HCI professionals face when applying the human-centered AI (HCAI) approach in the development of AI systems. We also identified seven main issues in human interaction with AI systems, which HCI professionals did not encounter when developing non-AI computing systems. To further enable the implementation of the HCAI approach, we identified new HCI opportunities tied to specific HCAIdriven design goals to guide HCI professionals addressing these new issues. Finally, our assessment of current HCI methods shows the limitations of these methods in support of developing AI systems. We propose the alternative methods that can help overcome these limitations and effectively help HCI professionals apply the HCAI approach to the development of AI systems. We also offer strategic recommendation for HCI professionals to effectively influence the development of AI systems with the HCAI approach, eventually developing HCAI systems. 3",,Review

Human-centered Artificial Intelligence: A Multidimensional Approach towards Real World Evidence,An iterative methodology using hermeneutics outlines the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence.,Search,2019,3,"Bettina  Schneider, Petra Maria Asprion, Frank  Grimberg",ICEIS,,10.5220/0007715503810390,https://doi.org/10.5220/0007715503810390,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f831bf2857fe27c3211f602f2839dec59222f251,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/603b/6573fa4f30d51652c687e3a6ace0bf6d3c01.pdf,"This study indicates the significance of a human-centered perspective in the analysis and interpretation of Real World Data. As an exemplary use-case, the construct of perceived ‘Health-related Quality of Life’ is chosen to show, firstly, the significance of Real World Data and, secondly, the associated ‘Real World Evidence’. We settled on an iterative methodology and used hermeneutics for a detailed literature analysis to outline the relevance and the need for a forward-thinking approach to deal with Real World Evidence in the life science and health care industry. The novelty of the study is its focus on a human-centered artificial intelligence, which can be achieved by using ‘System Dynamics’ modelling techniques. The outcome – a human-centered ‘Indicator Set’ can be combined with results from data-driven, AI-based analytics. With this multidimensional approach, human intelligence and artificial intelligence can be intertwined towards an enriched Real World Evidence. The developed approach considers three perspectives – the elementary, the algorithmic and – as novelty – the human-centered evidence. As conclusion, we claim that Real World Data are more valuable and applicable to achieve patient-centricity and personalization if the human-centered perspective is considered ‘by design’.",,
