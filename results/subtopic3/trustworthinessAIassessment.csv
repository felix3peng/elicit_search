Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be used for the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Exploring the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI in the Context of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems,The European Commission appointed experts to a High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI-HLEG).,Search,2021,,"Markus  Borg, Joshua  Bronson, Linus  Christensson, Fredrik  Olsson, Olof  Lennartsson, Elias  Sonnsjö, Hamid  Ebabi, Martin  Karsberg",2021 IEEE/ACM 2nd International Workshop on Ethics in Software Engineering Research and Practice (SEthics),,10.1109/SEthics52569.2021.00009,https://doi.org/10.1109/SEthics52569.2021.00009,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3063caad889735cd1279054c09a8cd3befea9848,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09051,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in critical applications. Thus, the need for dependable AI systems is rapidly growing. In 2018, the European Commission appointed experts to a High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI-HLEG). AI- HLEG defined Trustworthy AI as 1) lawful, 2) ethical, and 3) robust and specified seven corresponding key requirements. To help development organizations, AI-HLEG recently published the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI). We present an illustrative case study from applying ALTAI to an ongoing development project of an Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) that relies on Machine Learning (ML). Our experience shows that ALTAI is largely applicable to ADAS development, but specific parts related to human agency and transparency can be disregarded. Moreover, bigger questions related to societal and environmental impact cannot be tackled by an ADAS supplier in isolation. We present how we plan to develop the ADAS to ensure ALTAI-compliance. Finally, we provide three recommendations for the next revision of ALTAI, i.e., life-cycle variants, domainspecific adaptations, and removed redundancy.",,

Trustworthiness in Industrial IoT Systems Based on Artificial Intelligence,An automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS was proposed in this article.,Search,2021,81,"Zhihan  Lv, Yang  Han, Amit Kumar Singh, Gunasekaran  Manogaran, Haibin  Lv",IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,,10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2020.2994747,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79086f67c5d7413a05305478b1b38781588ed19d,,"The intelligent industrial environment developed with the support of the new generation network cyber-physical system (CPS) can realize the high concentration of information resources. In order to carry out the analysis and quantification for the reliability of CPS, an automatic online assessment method for the reliability of CPS is proposed in this article. It builds an evaluation framework based on the knowledge of machine learning, designs an online rank algorithm, and realizes the online analysis and assessment in real time. The preventive measures can be taken timely, and the system can operate normally and continuously. Its reliability has been greatly improved. Based on the credibility of the Internet and the Internet of Things, a typical CPS control model based on the spatiotemporal correlation detection model is analyzed to determine the comprehensive reliability model analysis strategy. Based on this, in this article, we propose a CPS trusted robust intelligent control strategy and a trusted intelligent prediction model. Through the simulation analysis, the influential factors of attack defense resources and the dynamic process of distributed cooperative control are obtained. CPS defenders in the distributed cooperative control mode can be guided and select the appropriate defense resource input according to the CPS attack and defense environment.",,

Here, we review relevant tools, practices, and data models for traceability in their connection to building AI models and systems. We also propose some minimal requirements to consider a model traceable according to the assessment list of the High-Level Expert Group on AI. Our review shows how, although a good number of reproducibility tools are available, a common approach is currently lacking, together with the need for shared semantics. Besides, we have detected that some tools have either not achieved full maturity, or are already falling into obsolescence or in a state of near abandonment by its developers, which might compromise the reproducibility of the research trusted to them.",,Review
Trustworthy AI: From Principles to Practices,Comprehensive trustworthy AI requires monitoring and governance.,Search,2021,1,"Bo  Li, Peng  Qi, Bo  Liu, Shuai  Di, Jingen  Liu, Jiquan  Pei, Jinfeng  Yi, Bowen  Zhou",ArXiv,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3689493757f90267908e776aeada9194fce55c7,,"Fast developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled various applied systems deployed in the real world, impacting people’s everyday lives. However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

The proposed metric is a significant step forward in the standardization process of AI systems. It is essential to standardize the AI systems’ trustworthiness, but until now, the standardization efforts remain at the level of high-level principles. The measurement methodology of the proposed includes human experts in the loop, and it is based on our trust management system. Our metric captures and quantifies the system’s transparent evaluation by field experts on as many control points as desirable by the users. We illustrate the trustworthy acceptance metric and its measurement methodology using AI in decision-making scenarios of Food-Energy-Water sectors. However, the proposed metric and its methodology can be easily adapted to other fields of AI applications. We show that our metric successfully captures the aggregated acceptance of any number of experts, can be used to do multiple measurements on various points of the system, and provides confidence values for the measured acceptance.

To address this problem, we propose a systematic method for assessing the trustworthiness of data items. Our approach uses the data provenance as well as their values in computing trust scores, that is, quantitative measures of trustworthiness. To obtain trust scores, we propose a cyclic framework which well reflects the inter-dependency property: the trust score of the data affects the trust score of the network nodes that created and manipulated the data, and vice-versa. The trust scores of data items are computed from their value similarity and provenance similarity. The value similarity comes from the principle that ""the more similar values for the same event, the higher the trust scores"". The provenance similarity is based on the principle that ""the more different data provenances with similar values, the higher the trust scores"". Experimental results show that our approach provides a practical solution for trustworthiness assessment in sensor networks.",,

We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use.

Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.",,
