Universal Artificial Intelligence,Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems.,Search,2005,233,Dr. Marcus Hutter,Texts in Theoretical Computer Science An EATCS Series,,10.1007/b138233,https://doi.org/10.1007/b138233,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/30a64bdf778b8f561af9ae589e822c2c800920b1,,"Foundational theories have contributed greatly to scientific progress in many fields. Examples include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory in mathematics, and universal Turing machines in computer science. Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) is an increasingly well-studied foundational theory for artificial intelligence, based on ancient principles in the philosophy of science and modern developments in information and probability theory. Importantly, it refrains from making unrealistic Markov, ergodicity, or stationarity assumptions on the environment. UAI provides a theoretically optimal agent AIXI and principled ideas for constructing practical autonomous agents. The theory also makes it possible to establish formal results on the motivations of AI systems. Such results may greatly enhance the trustability of autonomous agents, and guide design choices towards more robust agent architectures and incentive schemes. Finally, UAI offers a deeper appreciation of fundamental problems such as the induction problem and the exploration-exploitation dilemma .",,

New concepts, drawn from areas like artificial intelligence, operations research and control theory, are required in order to implement anthropomorphic tasks with minimum intervention of an operator. This work deals with the analytic formulation of the principle of increasing precision with decreasing intelligence; the fundamental principle of hierarchically intelligent control. A three-level structure representing the organization, coordination and execution has been developed as a probabilistic model of such a system and the approaches necessary to implement each one of them on an intelligent machine are discussed. The principle is derived also from a probabilistic model and can be expressed in terms of entropies. It is compatible with the current formulation of the hierarchically intelligent control problem, the mathematical programming solution of which minimizes the total entropy. The derivation and design of parallel architectures for artificial intelligence, like the Boltzmann machine is obtained from such formulation.",,

The use of Artificial Intelligence techniques in Computer-Assisted Instruction: an overview,One of the major goals of research in Artificial Intelligence is the representation of knowledge so that a computer can solve problems or communicate in a manner which exhibits “common sense”.,Search,1980,26,"Alice  Gable, Carl V.

Few programs for computers, including those for education, possess behavior which approaches any facet of the constellation of human skills and knowledge which are imprecisely called “common sense”. However, the revolutionary decline in hardware costs now makes it possible to consider economically viable, sophisticated designs for computer-aided instruction systems possessing some of the common sense attributes of a human tutor. In this survey we examine, in depth, techniques from Artificial Intelligence that can be used to endow a Computer-Aided Instruction system with approximations to some of the desirable qualities of a human tutor. We consider both techniques which have been proved in prototype systems for Computer-Aided Instruction and some techniques which were originally developed for other purposes.",,Review

Hopes that such a strategy would lead to clinically useful programs have not been fulfilled, but many of the problems impeding creation of effective artificial intelligence programs have been solved. Strategies have been developed to limit the number of hypotheses that a program must consider and to incorporate pathophysiologic reasoning. The latter innovation permits a program to analyze cases in which one disorder influences the presentation of another. Prototypes embodying such reasoning can explain their conclusions in medical terms that can be reviewed by the user. Despite these advances, further major research and developmental efforts will be necessary before expert performance by the computer becomes a reality.",,

Artificial intelligence for brain diseases: A systematic review,Artificial intelligence is a major branch of computer science that is fruitfully used for analyzing medical data and extracting meaningful relationships.,Search,2020,14,"Alice  Segato, Aldo  Marzullo, Francesco  Calimeri, Elena  De Momi",APL bioengineering,,10.1063/5.0011697,https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0011697,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/50a483975abba83f66b4d621f70f2d2128b93137,https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/1150452/2/Manuscript.pdf,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a major branch of computer science that is fruitfully used for analyzing complex medical data and extracting meaningful relationships in datasets, for several clinical aims. Specifically, in the brain care domain, several innovative approaches have achieved remarkable results and open new perspectives in terms of diagnosis, planning, and outcome prediction. In this work, we present an overview of different artificial intelligent techniques used in the brain care domain, along with a review of important clinical applications. A systematic and careful literature search in major databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science was carried out using “artificial intelligence” and “brain” as main keywords. Further references were integrated by cross-referencing from key articles. 155 studies out of 2696 were identified, which actually made use of AI algorithms for different purposes (diagnosis, surgical treatment, intra-operative assistance, and postoperative assessment). Artificial neural networks have risen to prominent positions among the most widely used analytical tools. Classic machine learning approaches such as support vector machine and random forest are still widely used. Task-specific algorithms are designed for solving specific problems. Brain images are one of the most used data types. AI has the possibility to improve clinicians' decision-making ability in neuroscience applications. However, major issues still need to be addressed for a better practical use of AI in the brain. To this aim, it is important to both gather comprehensive data and build explainable AI algorithms.",,Systematic Review

Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student. In fact, it allows a judicious evaluation which follows the enormous progress by adopting an automated method which takes into account the competence level of each pupil.",,

Both technological and cultural changes are required to realize the maximum capabilities of artificial intelligence. It needs to be implemented in all components of the business, and all departments and employees need to be given the opportunity to integrate artificial intelligence into their daily tasks. Such a fundamental change in corporate culture should begin with the leadership of the organization. This requires investment not only in technical infrastructure, but also in training staff so that all employees can derive the maximum possible benefits from artificial intelligence. In addition to changing culture, new generation technologies, such as a neural processor, are needed to develop artificial intelligence, which will allow the use of machine learning to obtain useful analytical information from data. Neural processors are able to fundamentally transform different industries through the application of artificial intelligence. This will allow firms to increase the creativity of their services. The importance of integrating artificial intelligence into the infrastructure of the future has already been recognized.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined as a subfield of computer science which deals with machines and software that appear to think and solve problems. The overall goal of much of the work in artificial intelligence is to develop systems that perform like human beings. Whether or not these systems are really ‘intelligent’ is a philosophical question. For our purposes, the fact that these systems mimic human intelligence to some extent at least is sufficient. AI programs are programs that exhibit behavior normally identified with human intelligence, and until recently, not with computers. In particular, AI programs seem to grasp ideas and concepts. For example, some can understand natural languages, some can see or perform difficult assembly tasks, and others can infer new information from facts provided to the system. However, software that makes computers seem intelligent is not that different from any other kind of software.",,
