Artificial Intelligence in Learning Skills Assessment: A Pedagogical Innovation,Competency-based learning assessment has recently undergone an important development in the field of education.,Search,2020,2,"Okacha  Diyer, Naceur  Achtaich, Khalid  Najib",NISS,,10.1145/3386723.3387901,https://doi.org/10.1145/3386723.3387901,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e314a810fd70edb39997d0b773e6203ca4471a99,,"Competency-based learning assessment has recently undergone an important development in the field of education. Its objective lies on offering learners the necessary skills to follow the enormous development of their environment, and to acquire the essentials capacities for various forms of interaction. This type of assessment is characterized by a diagnosis, remediation and improvement of the learners' skills without being limited to the assessment of knowledge. In this work, we propose an evaluation approach which is based on skills assessment strategy with interesting precision. Thus, the intelligent system detects the degree of learning skills C1 (Appropriate), C2 (Analyze and Reason), C3 (Realize), C4 (Validate) and C5 (communicate). In fact, the system used detects the level of the class in the different skills mentioned above, and offers educational situations to remedy the shortcomings that are encountered. Likewise, it offers the necessary support for each student by offering pedagogical situations whose objective is to increase the level of each learner skills (individualized assessment). The system also helps the teacher to make decisions to provide adequate supports. This device allows complete training for students, and it contributes to the development of a balanced (harmonized) personality in learning skills. This artificial intelligence that is involved allows performance while permanently monitoring each student. In fact, it allows a judicious evaluation which follows the enormous progress by adopting an automated method which takes into account the competence level of each pupil.",,

This list included: clinical validation, regular application updates, functional focus, cost, availability of an information block for specialists and patients, compliance with the conditions of government regulation, and registration. One of the applications that meet all the requirements is the ProRodinki software package, developed for use by patients and specialists in the Russian Federation.

The conception incorporates complex constructed-response items for their potential to increase the validity, instructional utility, and credibility of standardized tests. Artificial intelligence methods are invoked to produce item-level partial-credit scores and diagnostic analyses similar to those of a human expert. Finally, cognitively-grounded measurement models provide diagnostic statements based on commonalities in performance across items. Progress toward achieving this conception is examined, with emphasis on two automated scoring programs. Potential applications of intelligent assessment are discussed.",,
Towards General Evaluation of Intelligent Systems: Using Semantic Analysis to Improve Environments in the AIQ Test,The Algorithmic Intelligence Quotient test can be improved by reducing the proportion of problematic programs.,Search,2018,,Ondrej  Vadinský,AGI,,10.1007/978-3-319-97676-1_24,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-97676-1_24,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/922ad64a901bd48e720248bf7f43e65e051a60b3,,This paper conducted a semantic analysis of environment programs that are used in the Algorithmic Intelligence Quotient test to evaluate the intelligence of agents.

While impartial assessment can point to concrete contributions over the past 50 years (such as automated theorem proving, games strategies, the LISP and Prolog high-level computer languages, Automatic Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, mobile robot path planning, unmanned vehicles, humanoid robots, data mining, and more), the more cynical argue that AI has witnessed more than its fair share of ‘unmitigated disasters’ during this time – see, for example [3,58,107,125,186]. The general public becomes rapidly jaded with such ‘bold predictions’ that fail to live up to their original hype, and which ultimately render the zealots’ promises as counter-productive.",,

In this article, we propose a methodological model for a comprehensive ethical analysis of some uses of AI, notably as a replacement of human actors in specific activities. We emphasize the need for conceptual clarification of relevant key terms (e.g., intelligence) in order to undertake such reflection. Against that background, we distinguish two levels of ethical analysis, one practical and one theoretical. Focusing on the state of AI at present, we suggest that regardless of the presence of intelligence, the lack of morally relevant features calls for caution when considering the role of AI in some specific human activities.",,

Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) theory, in which fuzzy sets (membership functions) and their logic operations are determined by a consistent algorithm according to the distributions of original data and the semantics of the fuzzy concepts, is applied to study some new techniques of feature selection, concept categorization and characteristic description; problems often encountered in artificial intelligence area such as machine learning and pattern recognition. These techniques developed under the framework of AFS theory in this paper are more simple and more interpretable than the conventional methods, since they imitate the human recognition process. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature selection, the concept categorization and the characteristic description, these new techniques are applied to fuzzy clustering problems. Several benchmark data sets are used for this purpose. Clustering accuracies are comparable with or superior to the conventional algorithms such as FCM, k-means, and the new algorithm such as single point iterative weighted fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm.",,

In media coverage and reporting, AI is predominantly described in contrasted terms, either as the ultimate solution to all human problems or the ultimate threat to all human existence. In academe, the focus of computer scientists is on developing systems that function, whereas philosophy scholars theorize about the implications of this functionality for human life. In the interface between technology and philosophy there is, however, one imperative aspect of AI yet to be articulated: how do intelligent systems make inferences? We use the overarching concept “Artificial Intelligent Behaviour” which would include both cognition/processing and judgment/behaviour. We argue that due to the complexity and opacity of artificial inference, one needs to initiate systematic empirical studies of artificial intelligent behavior similar to what has previously been done to study human cognition, judgment and decision making. This will provide valid knowledge, outside of what current computer science methods can offer, about the judgments and decisions made by intelligent systems. Moreover, outside academe—in the public as well as the private sector—expertise in epistemology, critical thinking and reasoning are crucial to ensure human oversight of the artificial intelligent judgments and decisions that are made, because only competent human insight into AI-inference processes will ensure accountability. Such insights require systematic studies of AI-behaviour founded on the natural sciences and philosophy, as well as the employment of methodologies from the cognitive and behavioral sciences.",,

In the course of the short history of AI, the hypothesis became more explicit. More recently Allen Newell (1980) discussed it as the physical symbol system hypothesis, widely accepted both in (classical, not connectionistic) AI and in cognitive science.The level of explanation chosen as the crucial one was the symbol level.",,
