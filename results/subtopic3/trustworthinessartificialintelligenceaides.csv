AI has a lot of benefits when it comes to societal, individual or cultural development. But any mistake in either the development or in the working phase of the AI system can be disastrous, especially when human lives are involved. The main goal of this paper is to understand what really makes an Artificial Intelligence system trustworthy.",,

Trustworthy AI (TAI) bases on the idea that trust builds the foundation of societies, economies, and sustainable development, and that individuals, organizations, and societies will therefore only ever be able to realize the full potential of AI, if trust can be established in its development, deployment, and use. With this article we aim to introduce the concept of TAI and its five foundational principles (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. We further draw on these five principles to develop a data-driven research framework for TAI and demonstrate its utility by delineating fruitful avenues for future research, particularly with regard to the distributed ledger technology-based realization of TAI.",,
Questioning the Role of Moral AI as an Adviser within the Framework of Trustworthiness Ethics,"Regarding moral AI as an adviser, concerns exist regarding the trustworthiness ethics in Nickel’s sense.",Search,2021,,Silviya  Serafimova,Filosofiya-Philosophy,,10.53656/phil2021-04-07,https://doi.org/10.53656/phil2021-04-07,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/da0d6f6c6646773ec04772dad977f2e6f1e20155,,"The main objective of this article is to demonstrate why despite the growing interest in justifying AI’s trustworthiness, one can argue for AI’s reliability. By analyzing why trustworthiness ethics in Nickel’s sense provides some wellgrounded hints for rethinking the rational, affective and normative accounts of trust in respect to AI, I examine some concerns about the trustworthiness of Savulescu and Maslen’s model of moral AI as an adviser. Specifically, I tackle one of its exemplifications regarding Klincewicz’s hypothetical scenario of John which is refracted through the lens of the HLEG’s fifth requirement of trustworthy artificial intelligence (TAI), namely, that of Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness.",,
Trustworthy AI in the Age of Pervasive Computing and Big Data,"Trust in AI is intrinsically linked to the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice.",Search,2020,15,"Abhishek  Kumar, Tristan  Braud, Sasu  Tarkoma, Pan  Hui",2020 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops (PerCom Workshops),,10.1109/percomworkshops48775.2020.9156127,https://doi.org/10.1109/percomworkshops48775.2020.9156127,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f92cedfdf08f7c92ddefebd06fa763d7a8359c1f,http://repository.ust.hk/ir/bitstream/1783.1-101388/1/neutral-ai.pdf,"The era of pervasive computing has resulted in countless devices that continuously monitor users and their environment, generating an abundance of user behavioural data. Such data may support improving the quality of service, but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can benefit from these methods.",,
Trustworthy AI,The issue of bias and fairness in AI is required to enhance user and public trust in the technology.,Search,2021,,"Richa  Singh, Mayank  Vatsa, Nalini  Ratha",COMAD/CODS,,10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://doi.org/10.1145/3430984.3431966,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4f52a1c995d5b7ba2be6d419146dbf9ee6b0316c,,"Modern AI systems are reaping the advantage of novel learning methods. With their increasing usage, we are realizing the limitations and shortfalls of these systems. Brittleness to minor adversarial changes in the input data, ability to explain the decisions, address the bias in their training data, high opacity in terms of revealing the lineage of the system, how they were trained and tested, and under which parameters and conditions they can reliably guarantee a certain level of performance, are some of the most prominent limitations. Ensuring the privacy and security of the data, assigning appropriate credits to data sources, and delivering decent outputs are also required features of an AI system. We propose the tutorial on “Trustworthy AI” to address six critical issues in enhancing user and public trust in AI systems, namely: (i) bias and fairness, (ii) explainability, (iii) robust mitigation of adversarial attacks, (iv) improved privacy and security in model building, (v) being decent, and (vi) model attribution, including the right level of credit assignment to the data sources, model architectures, and transparency in lineage.",,

At the same time, there is also awareness of potential risks and harm that may be caused by unregulated developments of artificial intelligence. Guiding principles are being developed around the world to foster trustworthy development and application of artificial intelligence systems. These guidelines can support developers and governing authorities when making decisions about the use of artificial intelligence. The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission launched the report Ethical guidelines for trustworthy artificial intelligence in2019. The report aims to contribute to reflections and the discussion on the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies also beyond the countries of the European Union (EU). In this paper, we use the global health sector as a case and argue that the EU’s guidance leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally. We point to the urgency of shared globalized efforts to safeguard against the potential harms of artificial intelligence technologies in health care.",,

Even though these AI-based systems frequently provide state-of-the-art performance, humans still hesitate to develop, deploy, and use AI systems. The main reason for this is the lack of trust in AI systems caused by the deficiency of transparency of existing AI systems. As a solution, “Trustworthy AI” research area merged with the goal of defining guidelines and frameworks for improving user trust in AI systems, allowing humans to use them without fear. While trust in AI is an active area of research, very little work exists where the focus is to build human trust to improve the interactions between human and AI systems. In this paper, we provide a concise survey on concepts of trustworthy AI. Further, we present trustworthy AI development guidelines for improving the user trust to enhance the interactions between AI systems and humans, that happen during the AI system life cycle.",,

Such systems provide customers with timely, informed, and customized inferences to aid their decision, while at the same time utilizing appropriate security protection mechanisms for AI models. Additionally, such systems should also use Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to protect customers' data at any time.

To approach the subject, we start by introducing trends in AI inference systems. We continue by elaborating on the relationship between Intellectual Property (IP) and private data protection in such systems. Regarding the protection mechanisms, we survey the security and privacy building blocks instrumental in designing, building, deploying, and operating private AI inference systems. For example, we highlight opportunities and challenges in AI systems using trusted execution environments combined with more recent advances in cryptographic techniques to protect data in use. Finally, we outline areas of further development that require the global collective attention of industry, academia, and government researchers to sustain the operation of trustworthy AI inference systems.",,

However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review

Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Education: Pitfalls and Pathways,Artificial Intelligence in education poses ethical risks which should be monitored by policymakers.,Search,2020,,Nathalie A.

This development was further spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, which rendered many educational institutions dependent on (AI-enabled) digital learning tools to continue their activities. While the use of AI systems can lead to numerous benefits, it can also entail ethical risks, which are increasingly appearing on legislators’ agendas. Many of these risks are context-specific and increase in significance when vulnerable individuals are involved, asymmetries of power exist, or human rights and democratic values are at stake more generally. Surprisingly, however, regulators have thus far paid only little attention to the specific risks arising in the context of Artificial Intelligence in education (AIED). This paper hence aims to assess the ethical challenges posed by AIED. Its normative framework consists of the seven requirements for Trustworthy AI, as set out in the Ethics Guidelines of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI. After an overview of the broader context in which these requirements took shape (Section 2), the paper examines each requirement in the educational realm, as well as the pitfalls that should be addressed to enable their realisation (Section 3). Particular attention is given to the special role of education in shaping people’s minds, and the manner in which this role can be used both to empower and exploit individuals. The paper notes that AIED’s main strengths – offering education on a wider scale, through more flexible and individualised learning methods, and through the closer monitoring of students’ reception of the materials – are also its main liabilities when left unchecked. Finally, the paper discusses various pathways that policymakers should consider to foster Trustworthy AIED beyond the adoption of guidelines (Section 4), before concluding (Section 5).",,Review

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), education faces two challenges: reaping the benefits of AI to improve education processes, both in the classroom and at the system level; and preparing students for new skillsets for increasingly automated economies and societies. AI applications are often still nascent, but there are many examples of promising uses that foreshadow how AI might transform education. With regard to the classroom, this paper highlights how AI can accelerate personalised learning, the support of students with special needs. At the system level, promising uses include predictive analysis to reduce dropout, and assessing new skillsets. A new demand for complex skills that are less easy to automate (e.g. higher cognitive skills like creativity and critical thinking) is also the consequence of AI and digitalisation. Reaching the full potential of AI requires that stakeholders trust not only the technology, but also its use by humans. This raises new policy challenges around “trustworthy AI”, encompassing the privacy and security of data, but also possible wrongful uses of data leading to biases against individuals or groups.",,
