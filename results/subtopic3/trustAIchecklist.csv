Opening the software engineering toolbox for the assessment of trustworthy AI,Software engineering and testing practices can be applied to the assessment of trustworthy AI.,Search,2020,2,"Mohit Kumar Ahuja, Mohamed-Bachir  Belaid, Pierre  Bernab'e, Mathieu  Collet, Arnaud  Gotlieb, Chhagan  Lal, Dusica  Marijan, Sagar  Sen, Aizaz  Sharif, Helge  Spieker",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3b0ff6bd000e9c615d024614343f2c1cf12bf124,,"Trustworthiness is a central requirement for the acceptance and success of human-centered artificial intelligence (AI). To deem an AI system as trustworthy, it is crucial to assess its behaviour and characteristics against a gold standard of Trustworthy AI, consisting of guidelines, requirements, or only expectations. While AI systems are highly complex, their implementations are still based on software. The software engineering community has a long-established toolbox for the assessment of software systems, especially in the context of software testing. In this paper, we argue for the application of software engineering and testing practices for the assessment of trustworthy AI. We make the connection between the seven key requirements as defined by the European Commission's AI high-level expert group and established procedures from software engineering and raise questions for future work.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence,"AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things.",Search,2018,14,Arathi  Sethumadhavan,Ergonomics in Design: The Quarterly of Human Factors Applications,,10.1177/1064804618818592,https://doi.org/10.1177/1064804618818592,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/94a43052c729c8e7e3f28c50c76e46d09ec95f62,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1064804618818592,"Trust is fundamental to creating a lasting relationship with another human being. In our daily lives, we encounter several situations where we place trust on other humans such as bus drivers, colleagues, and even strangers. Trust in human-human teams is initially founded on the predictability of the trustee, and as the relationship between the trustor and the trustee progresses, dependability or integrity replaces predictability as the basis of trust (Hoff & Bashir, 2015). As artificial intelligence (AI) gets smarter and smarter, it is becoming an integral part of human lives. For example, AI is being used for scheduling appointments, powering smart homes, recognizing people’s faces in photos, making health diagnoses, providing investment advice, and several other things. As with a humanhuman team, trust is a necessary ingredient for human-AI partnerships. However, trust in human-human teams progresses in the reverse order from human-human teams (e.g., Hoff & Bashir, 2015). This is because humans initially assume that AI is near perfect. Therefore, in the initial stages, faith forms the essential constituent of trust, and as the number of exchanges between the human and the AI increases, faith is replaced by dependability and predictability. Trust in AI is considered a twodimensional construct comprising trust and distrust, where trust is associated with feelings of calmness and security and distrust involves fear and worry (Lyons, Stokes, Eschleman, Alarcon, & Barelka, 2011). Unarguably, trust is a complex social process with a variety of factors determining the extent to which humans trust AI agents (Hoff & Bashir, 2015; Lee & See, 2004). Specifically, in order to calibrate the right level of trust in AI, consider dispositional (i.e., user characteristics such as age, culture, gender, and personality), internal (e.g., user characteristics such as workload, mood, self-confidence, and working memory capacity), environmental (e.g., task difficulty, perceived risks and benefits, organizational setting), and learned factors (e.g., reputation of the AI, reliability, consistency, type and timing of errors made by the AI, and users’ experience with similar agents). Design factors (e.g., appearance, ease of use, communication style, and transparency of the AI) also affect perceptions of trust. For example, anthrophomorphizing is an effective way of establishing a long-term social bond between humans and AI agents, which is driven by the neurotransmitter and hormone, oxytocin (e.g., de Visser et al., 2017). Further, anthropomorphic agents also resist breakdown in trust compared to their counterpart non-anthropomorphic agents, presumably because anthropomorphic agents remind users of humans who are forgiven more easily for being imperfect in comparison to machine-like agents. Interestingly, there is also evidence that humans tend to disclose more information to AI therapists than human therapists. Transparency of the AI also helps to calibrate the right level of trust by enabling users to develop accurate mental models of the AI underpinnings (e.g., Balfe, Sharples, & Wilson, 2018). 818592 ERGXXX10.1177/1064804618818592ergonomics in designergonomics in design research-article2018",,
An agile framework for trustworthy AI,The AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) ethics guidelines present a list of requirements that trustworthy AI systems should meet.,Search,2020,2,"Stefan  Leijnen, Huib  Aldewereld, Rudy van Belkom, Roland  Bijvank, Roelant  Ossewaarde",NeHuAI@ECAI,,,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/880049a16c8fea47dcfe07450668f5507db5e96d,,"From the article: The ethics guidelines put forward by the AI High Level Expert Group (AI-HLEG) present a list of seven key requirements that Human-centered, trustworthy AI systems should meet. These guidelines are useful for the evaluation of AI systems, but can be complemented by applied methods and tools for the development of trustworthy AI systems in practice. In this position paper we propose a framework for translating the AI-HLEG ethics guidelines into the specific context within which an AI system operates. This approach aligns well with a set of Agile principles commonly employed in software engineering. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2659/",,

However, the diffusion of AI proceeds very slowly and falls behind, especially in comparison to other technologies. An important path leading to better adoption rates identified is trust-building. Particular requirements for trust and their relevance for AI adoption are currently insufficiently addressed.Design/methodology/approachTo close this gap, the authors follow a qualitative approach, drawing on the extended valence framework by assessing semi-structured interviews with experts from various companies.FindingsThe authors contribute to research by finding several subcategories for the three main trust dimensions ability, integrity and benevolence, thereby revealing fundamental differences for building trust in AI compared to more traditional technologies. In particular, the authors find access to knowledge, transparency, explainability, certification, as well as self-imposed standards and guidelines to be important factors that increase overall trust in AI.Originality/valueThe results show how the valence framework needs to be elaborated to become applicable to the AI context and provide further structural orientation to better understand AI adoption intentions. This may help decision-makers to identify further requirements or strategies to increase overall trust in their AI products, creating competitive and operational advantage.",,
Trust in Artificial Intelligence: Australian Insights,Australia has low trust in AI but generally accepts or tolerates AI.,Search,2020,5,"Steve  Lockey, Nicole  Gillespie, Caitlin  Curtis",,,10.14264/b32f129,https://doi.org/10.14264/b32f129,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6c2714f81bc323851052920d240bc21b98e2a9f8,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:b32f129/LockeyGillespieCurtis_Trust_In_AI.pdf,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the cornerstone technology of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and is enabling rapid innovation with many potential benefits for Australian society (e.g. enhanced healthcare diagnostics, transportation optimisation) and business (e.g. enhanced efficiency and competitiveness). The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the uptake of advanced technology, and investment in AI continues to grow exponentially.AI also poses considerable risks and challenges to society which raises concerns about whether AI systems are worthy of trust. These concerns have been fuelled by high profile cases of AI use that were biased, discriminatory, manipulative, unlawful, or violated privacy or other human rights. Without public confidence that AI is being developed and used in an ethical and trustworthy manner, it will not be trusted and its full potential will not be realised. To echo the sentiment of Dr Alan Finkel AO, Australia’s Chief Scientist, acceptance of AI rests on “the essential foundation of trust”. Are we capable of extending our trust to AI? This national survey is the first to take a deep dive into answering this question and understanding community trust and expectations in relation to AI. To do this, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of over 2,500 Australian citizens in June to July 2020. Our findings provide important and timely research insights into the public’s trust and attitudes towards AI and lay out a pathway for strengthening trust and acceptance of AI systems.Key findings include:              - Trust is central to the acceptance of AI, and is influenced by four key drivers;              - Australians have low trust in AI systems but generally ‘accept’ or ‘tolerate’ AI;              - Australians expect AI to be regulated and carefully managed;              - Australians expect organisations to uphold the principles of trustworthy AI;              - Australians feel comfortable with some but not all uses of AI at work;              - Australians want to know more about AI but currently have low awareness and understanding of AI and its uses.We draw out the implications of the findings for government, business and NGOs and provide a roadmap to enhancing public trust in AI highlighting three key actions:              - Live up to Australian’s expectations of trustworthy AI              - Strengthen the regulatory framework for governing AI              - Strengthen Australia’s AI literacy",,

In this paper, we propose a supplier's declaration of conformity (SDoC) for AI services to help increase trust in AI services. An SDoC is a transparent, standardized, but often not legally required, document used in many industries and sectors to describe the lineage of a product along with the safety and performance testing it has undergone. We envision an SDoC for AI services to contain purpose, performance, safety, security, and provenance information to be completed and voluntarily released by AI service providers for examination by consumers. Importantly, it conveys product-level rather than component-level functional testing. We suggest a set of declaration items tailored to AI and provide examples for two fictitious AI services.",,

He was previously a Program Manager at the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in charge of programs relating to the application of autonomy and artificial intelligence (AI) to such applications as unmanned aerial vehicles. He was also in charge of a program to fast-track the development of emerging robotic technologies to respond to defence needs.

KI: In many applications, particularly the ones that you’ve worked in, it is, of course, critical that one’s equipment and tools can be trusted, regardless of the presence of AI. Can you tell us a bit about what is generally expected for a firefighter, rescuer, astronaut, or soldier to trust their equipment? In my experience, for these domains, trust comes down to reliability and the ability to do no harm. In this context, reliability is the equipment’s ability to perform the same task, repeatedly, over time, with consistent and accurate results. A good example is gas detection meters that may be used by firefighters, astronauts, or soldiers. Regardless of the technical capabilities or features, the meter needs to provide accurate and timely information about the gasses it can measure and act appropriately. The requirement for consistency is why you often observe personnel taking quasi-ownership of the equipment. Within the fire service especially you see hazardous material technicians say, “This is my gas meter”, and they are very hesitant to use any other piece of equipment in the course of their emergency response activities. The same can often be said for supplied air devices and personal protective equipment. In doing no harm, the equipment needs to not further degrade the situation. In any lifethreatening domain, the equipment and technology need to have guarantees that it can never make the situation worse either through hardware or software design. In the case of hardware, there are often safety and manufacturing quality standards and testing organizations that can provide some level of assurance that the equipment can do no further harm. In the case of software, there is less standardization, but the use of formal methods for testing and verification can significantly enhance the safety, reliability, and therefore trust in the system. KI: How have AI systems in general been treated differently by these sectors? Why are they different? * Raymond Ka-Man Sheh raymond.sheh@curtin.edu.au",,

However, many current AI systems were found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection, etc., which not only degrades user experience but erodes the society’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we strive to provide AI practitioners a comprehensive guide towards building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, alignment with human values, and accountability. We then survey leading approaches in these aspects in the industry. To unify the current fragmented approaches towards trustworthy AI, we propose a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items to practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges in the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for paradigm shift towards comprehensive trustworthy AI systems.",,Review
